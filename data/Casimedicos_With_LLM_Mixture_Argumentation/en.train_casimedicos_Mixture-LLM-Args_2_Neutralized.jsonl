What do you think is the most correct approach?  The most correct approach is to take a biopsy for H. Pylori, remove the endoscope taking care not to dislodge the platelet thrombus, and continue pharmacological treatment with i.v. PPI. This approach is chosen because the patient has presented with a gastric ulcer that has stopped bleeding, and it is important to ensure that the bleeding does not recur. Taking a biopsy for H. Pylori is crucial to determine the underlying cause of the ulcer and to guide treatment for eradication. Removing the endoscope carefully avoids dislodging the platelet thrombus that has formed over the ulcer, which could lead to rebleeding.

His family reports recurrent visual hallucinations, occasional falls and striking motor slowing. What is the most likely diagnosis?  The patient's symptoms of progressive cognitive impairment, memory lapses, orientation problems, visual hallucinations, falls, and motor slowing are indicative of dementia with diffuse Lewy bodies. This condition is characterized by fluctuating cognitive impairment, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. Alzheimer's type dementia typically does not present with visual hallucinations or prominent motor symptoms early in the disease course. Multi-infarct vascular dementia would be less likely without a history of strokes or significant vascular risk factors.

The patient's presentation of bilateral paralysis of the upper extremities that started abruptly, along with a lack of concern or understanding of her condition, suggests a psychological origin rather than a physical one. The recent stressor of her son's arrest and the family's inability to contact him provides a context for a psychogenic disorder. The most likely diagnosis in this case is a conversive disorder, also known as functional neurological disorder, where psychological stressors manifest as physical symptoms. This diagnosis is supported by the absence of findings on a neurological exam that would explain the paralysis, and the presence of a clear stressor that could have triggered the symptoms.", "options": {"1": "Conversive disorder.", "2": "Hypochondriasis.", "3": "Delusional disorder.", "4": "Factitious disorder.", "5": "Major depressive disorder."}, "correct_option": 1}

This is supported by the clinical presentation of asthenia, anorexia, weight loss, jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain, along with the laboratory findings of leukocytosis, elevated bilirubin with direct predominance, significantly elevated AST (GOT) and GGT levels, and prothrombin time prolongation. These findings are consistent with alcoholic liver disease, which can lead to alcoholic hepatitis, characterized by inflammation and damage to the liver due to chronic alcohol consumption. The absence of recent history of blood transfusion, risky sexual contacts, or addiction to parenteral drugs makes viral hepatitis less likely. The elevated leukocyte count and polymorphonuclear predominance suggest an inflammatory process, which is not typically seen in hepatic abscess, acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, or acute pancreatitis.

Endoscopic ultrasound and PET-CT scan were requested where no pathological lymphadenopathies were observed. Which of the following options would be the most correct?   In this case, the most correct option would be Chemotherapy plus preoperative radiotherapy. This is because squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is highly sensitive to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Preoperative chemoradiation can significantly reduce the size of the tumor, making it more resectable and potentially increasing the chances of achieving clear surgical margins. Additionally, this approach aims to treat any microscopic metastatic disease that may not be detected on imaging, thereby improving overall survival rates. The choice of transhiatal esophagectomy or esophagectomy according to the Ivor-Lewis technique would depend on the location and extent of the tumor, as well as other patient-specific factors, following the completion of neoadjuvant therapy.

Regarding the disease from which this patient suffers, one of the following statements is FALSE. Point out which one:  In Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH), there is a defect in the LDL receptor leading to high LDL cholesterol levels. The statement that the genetic disorder also affects the synthesis of triglycerides, causing in the advanced stages of the disease, an increase in triglycerides, which is usually higher than 500 mg/dl, is FALSE. This is because the primary defect in FH is related to LDL cholesterol metabolism, and although there can be some elevation in triglycerides, it is not typically higher than 500 mg/dl.

What is the most likely diagnostic hypothesis?  The most likely diagnostic hypothesis in this case is Hemophilia A. This is supported by the presence of hemarthrosis (swelling of the joint due to bleeding) in a young male with a normal vaccination schedule and no history of trauma. The prolonged APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) is indicative of a deficiency in clotting factors, which is characteristic of hemophilia A. Additionally, the family history of a similar problem in an uncle suggests a genetic component, which is consistent with the X-linked inheritance pattern of hemophilia A.

What is the most advisable therapeutic approach?  The most advisable therapeutic approach is watchful waiting. The patient is asymptomatic with normal chest X-ray, blood tests, and urine sediment. Positive ANCA does not necessarily indicate active disease and there is no evidence of active vasculitis or glomerulonephritis.

In the gynecological examination she only shows pain when pressing on the posterior vaginal fornix. Which test do you consider would allow you to reach a diagnosis of certainty of her pathology?  Diagnostic laparoscopy would allow for a definitive diagnosis in this case. This procedure enables direct visualization of the pelvic and abdominal cavities, which is essential for identifying any endometriotic lesions or other pathologies that may be causing the patient's symptoms. Transvaginal ultrasound, while useful for evaluating pelvic structures, may not provide a clear view of endometriosis or other conditions affecting fertility. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can offer detailed images of soft tissues but may not definitively diagnose endometriosis.

This is because NSAIDs can cause renal toxicity, leading to decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, resulting in acute kidney injury. The presence of poorly expressive urine sediment and low-grade proteinuria further supports this diagnosis. While glomerulonephritis secondary to rheumatoid arthritis can also occur, the clinical presentation and the use of NSAIDs make renal failure due to NSAIDs more probable. Renal amyloidosis and interstitial nephritis due to methotrexate are less likely given the acute presentation and the fact that methotrexate is more commonly associated with chronic interstitial nephritis.", "options": {"1": "Renal amyloidosis.", "2": "Renal failure due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.", "3": "", "4": "Glomerulonephritis secondary to rheumatoid arthritis.", "5": "Interstitial nephritis due to methotrexate."}, "correct_option": 5}

This condition is characterized by a benign tumor within the ducts of the breast, which can cause bloody or serous discharge. It is typically unilateral and there is no associated palpable mass. Paget's disease of the nipple, on the other hand, presents with eczematous changes of the nipple and areola, and infiltrating ductal carcinoma is usually associated with a palpable mass.

He goes to the genetic consultation with his wife, to assess the risks of transmission of the disease. What correct information will be provided in the course of the genetic counseling?  Becker muscular dystrophy is caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene located on the X chromosome. Since the man has a partial deletion in this gene, he has Becker muscular dystrophy. This means that he has one X chromosome with the mutation and one Y chromosome. Since his wife does not have the mutation, she will contribute one X chromosome without the mutation to their offspring. Therefore, their daughters will receive one X chromosome with the mutation from their father and one X chromosome without the mutation from their mother, making them carriers of the disease but not affected.

Mark the correct statement:  The patient is experiencing a subacute deterioration following the treatment of a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm. This deterioration is most likely due to vasospasm, which is a common complication following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Vasospasm typically occurs around one week to one month after the hemorrhage, leading to symptoms such as confusion and difficulty obeying commands. While aneurysm rebleeding and hydrocephalus are also potential causes of deterioration in this context, the timing and clinical presentation strongly suggest vasospasm as the most likely cause.

The first attitude will be:  The patient's symptoms suggest a possible cervical radiculopathy, characterized by neck pain radiating to the arm and hand, accompanied by paresthesia. This condition is likely due to compression or irritation of a nerve root in the cervical spine. The absence of objectifiable loss of strength and preserved neck mobility suggest a non-surgical approach as the initial management. Conservative treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, local heat, and relative rest is often effective in relieving pain and reducing inflammation in such cases. Urgent surgical evaluation is not indicated at this stage, as the clinical presentation does not suggest a more severe condition requiring immediate intervention.

X-ray shows a displaced subcapital fracture of the right hip. What is the recommended treatment?  The recommended treatment for a 95-year-old woman with a displaced subcapital fracture of the right hip is hip hemiarthroplasty. This is because hip hemiarthroplasty is a surgical procedure that replaces the broken portion of the hip with an artificial ball and socket joint. It is typically recommended for elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures, as it allows for early mobilization and reduces the risk of complications associated with prolonged immobility.

Point out the correct answer:  In the case of a woman who is a carrier of a premutation in the FMR1 gene, responsible for Fragile X syndrome, and who wishes to have offspring, it is important to consider the inheritance pattern of the condition. Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked dominant disorder, which means that females who carry one mutated copy of the FMR1 gene are usually asymptomatic or have milder symptoms compared to males who have only one X chromosome. Therefore, if the woman has a male child, there is a 50% chance that he will inherit the mutated gene and be affected by Fragile X syndrome. On the other hand, if she has a female child, there is also a 50% chance that she will inherit the mutated gene, but as a carrier, she will not typically manifest the clinical symptoms of the disease. This information should be conveyed to the woman as part of genetic and reproductive counseling. It is also important to discuss the option of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for couples at risk of transmitting genetic disorders to their offspring. PGD allows for the screening of embryos created through in vitro fertilization (IVF) for specific genetic mutations, including those associated with Fragile X syndrome.

What attitude or test do you think is the most appropriate to recommend at that moment?  Given the patient's family history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most appropriate attitude or test to recommend for the 34-year-old brother, who is unaware of his disease status, would be a screening test to assess for the presence of the disease. ADPKD is a hereditary disorder characterized by the development of multiple cysts in the kidneys and other organs. It is typically diagnosed using imaging studies that can visualize the presence of kidney cysts. Among the options provided, an abdomino-pelvic ultrasound would be the most suitable initial screening test for this individual. It is non-invasive, widely available, and highly sensitive in detecting kidney cysts, which would help determine whether the brother has inherited the disease or not. Genetic mutational and linkage studies, while useful for confirming a diagnosis and determining the specific gene mutation, are not the first-line screening tests for ADPKD.

What is the most likely diagnosis?  The presence of hematuria, dysmorphic red blood cells, and proteinuria suggests a glomerular cause. IgA nephropathy is the most common form of glomerulonephritis and is often associated with respiratory infections. The absence of other significant findings in the blood test and the presence of dysmorphic red blood cells indicate that a primary glomerular disease is more likely than a secondary cause.

Of the following, indicate the correct option:  Given the patient's presentation of cyanotic mottled lesions on the toes, history of smoking, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, and imaging findings of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm with mural thrombus, the most appropriate intervention is open surgical repair. This is because the aneurysm is at risk of rupture, which is a life-threatening complication. Open surgical repair involves replacing the aneurysmal segment with a tubular prosthesis and reimplantation of the supra-aortic trunks. This approach is necessary to prevent rupture and to restore proper blood flow. Statin therapy is not sufficient to stabilize the thrombus in this case, and urgent diagnostic aortography is not necessary as the diagnosis has already been made with CT angiography.

The most appropriate approach in this case is:  The patient presents with symptoms consistent with erythema nodosum, a skin condition commonly associated with inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease. It is characterized by painful, red, hot subcutaneous nodules, typically located on the shins. In this case, the appearance of these nodules is also associated with an increase in bowel movements and abdominal pain, suggesting an exacerbation of the underlying Crohn's disease.

The patient maintains good visual acuity. Where would you most likely locate the lesion?  The presence of palpebral ptosis and anisocoria, with the left pupil being smaller than the right, suggests a dysfunction of the oculomotor nerve (III cranial pair), which is responsible for most of the eye movements, including eyelid elevation, and the constriction of the pupil. This nerve also provides parasympathetic innervation to the eye, which can explain the miosis (smaller pupil) on the affected side.

Mark the correct statement:  The patient is experiencing a subacute deterioration following the treatment of a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm. This deterioration is most likely due to vasospasm, which is a common complication following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Vasospasm typically occurs around one week to one month after the hemorrhage, leading to symptoms such as confusion and difficulty obeying commands. While aneurysm rebleeding and hydrocephalus are also potential causes of deterioration in this context, the timing and clinical presentation strongly suggest vasospasm as the most likely cause.

Given this picture, which of the following diagnoses do you think is the most likely?  The presence of abundant hard exudates, small deep hemorrhages, and a localized neurosensory retinal detachment in the left eye, along with abundant soft drusen in the contralateral eye, is indicative of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This diagnosis is supported by the clinical presentation of sudden vision loss, metamorphopsia, and the characteristic fundoscopic findings. Acute posterior vitreous detachment typically presents with symptoms of floaters and flashes but would not explain the other findings. Central retinal artery obstruction would lead to a sudden painless loss of vision but would not typically present with hemorrhages or retinal detachment.

In the case of a 67-year-old woman with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast and no family history of neoplasia, the study of hormone receptors and HER2 should be performed on the tumor. This is because these markers have important clinical-therapeutic implications, as they can influence treatment decisions and prognosis. The study of hormone receptors (such as estrogen and progesterone receptors) helps determine whether the cancer is hormone-sensitive and if hormonal therapy could be beneficial.

This indicates a state of hypogonadism, which can be caused by various factors. However, hyperprolactinemia is not listed as an option, and it is a condition that can also lead to decreased levels of FSH and LH due to the inhibitory effect of prolactin on the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.

Given the patient's symptoms of intense pain in the leg, especially at night, along with the absence of distal pulses and the presence of varicose veins, the first examination to be performed should be focused on assessing arterial flow. This is because the symptoms suggest possible peripheral arterial disease, which is common in patients with hypertension and diabetes. The ankle-brachial index is a non-invasive test that compares the blood pressure in the lower legs to the arms and is the initial diagnostic test for peripheral arterial disease.

He only has dyspnea when climbing stairs and some nights he sleeps irregularly due to coughing. Which of the following therapeutic options should be considered as the treatment of choice?  The treatment of choice should be to switch to combined therapy with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-adrenergics. This is because the patient has been stable with no exacerbations and only occasional dyspnea and coughing, indicating that his current regimen may not be fully controlling his symptoms. Adding a long-acting beta2-adrenergic to the existing inhaled corticosteroid can improve symptom control and reduce the need for rescue medication, which the patient is using once a day.

This risk is higher in patients with extensive colitis, like pancolitis, and in those with a longer duration of the disease. Although the risk decreases in patients in long-term remission, it does not return to the baseline risk of the general population. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with ulcerative colitis undergo regular colonoscopy screening with multiple biopsies at different locations in the colon. This approach is more appropriate than screening with fecal occult blood tests, which may miss dysplastic lesions.

The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is temporal arteritis, which is an inflammatory condition of the blood vessels, particularly the temporal arteries. This condition can lead to sudden and painless vision loss due to ischemia of the optic nerve. The symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, muscle and joint pain are also consistent with temporal arteritis.

Which of the following measures would NOT be included in the INITIAL management?  In the initial management of septic shock, measures aimed at restoring tissue perfusion and controlling infection are prioritized. Fluid administration is crucial to correct hypotension and improve organ perfusion. Serum lactate measurement helps assess the severity of shock and monitor response to treatment.

There are no hallucinations or behavioral disorder. Current Minimental is 24/30 and Yesavage test 14/15, there is no neurological focality, tremor or tone or gait disorders on physical examination. Two months ago he came to the emergency department after a mild traumatic brain injury due to an accidental fall (the only one in 2 years) and a CT scan was performed which did not provide new information compared to the previous MRI. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?  The most likely diagnosis in this patient is Alzheimer's disease. This is supported by the progressive memory impairment, slow evolution, absence of neurological focality, tremor or tone or gait disorders, and the presence of diffuse cortical atrophy predominantly in the posterior area on MRI. The mild traumatic brain injury is unlikely to have caused the cognitive impairment, as there were no new findings on CT scan compared to the previous MRI.

Which of the following is a poor prognostic factor after surgical resection and should be taken into account when planning chemotherapy treatment?  The size of the primary lesion and histological differentiation are considered poor prognostic factors in adenocarcinoma of the colon.

In patients starting long-term corticosteroid therapy, such as prednisone for temporal arteritis, the risk of developing osteoporosis and fractures increases significantly. Given the delay of 4-5 months for a DXA scan, which is the gold standard for assessing bone mineral density and diagnosing osteoporosis, it is not feasible to wait for the results before initiating preventive treatment. The FRAX questionnaire can estimate the 10-year fracture risk based on clinical risk factors without the need for BMD measurement. However, in this case, the patient is already at an increased risk due to the use of corticosteroids, and the FRAX tool may underestimate her true risk. Therefore, the most appropriate approach is to initiate empirical treatment with bisphosphonates and vitamin D, which have been shown to reduce the risk of fractures in patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy.

Analysis: CRP 6 mg/dl (VN <1); hemoglobin 10.5 g/dl; ESR 92 mm. Chest X-ray normal. Considering the most likely diagnosis, check the correct option regarding treatment:  The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is an inflammatory vasculopathy that primarily affects large and medium-sized arteries, and is characterized by headache, jaw claudication, visual disturbances, and elevated inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR. The absence of pulse in the left temporal artery further supports this diagnosis. Treatment for GCA typically involves high-dose glucocorticoids to reduce inflammation and prevent further complications. However, in patients who have ischemic symptoms or contraindications to glucocorticoids, alternative treatments such as tocilizumab may be considered. Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist that has been shown to be effective in reducing disease activity and glucocorticoid cumulative dose in patients with GCA.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is complex focal temporal lobe seizures. This diagnosis is supported by the presence of an ascending epigastric sensation and an unpleasant odor, which are common auras associated with temporal lobe seizures. The stereotyped nature of the episodes, including the sucking movements and repeated opening and closing movements of the left hand, further supports this diagnosis.

No ascites or evidence of peritoneal irritation. Laboratory tests include leukocytes 15,000/microliter with 90% polymorphonuclear, red blood cells 3 million/mm3, hemoglobin 10g/dl, mean corpuscular volume 115 fl, bilirubin 15 mg/dl direct predominance, AST (GOT) 300 IU/L, ALT (GPT) 120 IU/L, GGT 635 IU/L, prothrombin time prolongation greater than 50%. What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient's condition?  The most likely diagnosis of the patient's condition is alcoholic hepatitis. This is supported by the clinical presentation of asthenia, anorexia, weight loss, jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain, along with the laboratory findings of leukocytosis, elevated bilirubin with direct predominance, significantly elevated AST (GOT) and GGT levels, and prothrombin time prolongation. These findings are consistent with alcoholic liver disease, which can lead to alcoholic hepatitis, characterized by inflammation and damage to the liver due to chronic alcohol consumption. The absence of recent history of blood transfusion, risky sexual contacts, or addiction to parenteral drugs makes viral hepatitis less likely. The elevated leukocyte count and polymorphonuclear predominance suggest an inflammatory process, which is not typically seen in hepatic abscess, acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, or acute pancreatitis.

Given the patient's symptoms of non-radiating lumbar pain, progressive intensity, marked limitation of spinal mobility, febrile fever, and normal lumbar spine X-ray, the diagnosis to rule out first is pyogenic spondylodiscitis. This is because pyogenic spondylodiscitis can present with similar symptoms and is associated with destructive changes in the intervertebral disc and adjacent vertebral bodies, which may not be visible on a plain X-ray.

{"question": "What genetic and reproductive counseling would you indicate to a 30-year-old woman who consults because she is a carrier of a premutation in the FMR1 gene, responsible for Fragile X syndrome, and who wishes to have offspring. Point out the correct answer:  In the case of a woman who is a carrier of a premutation in the FMR1 gene, responsible for Fragile X syndrome, and who wishes to have offspring, it is important to consider the inheritance pattern of the condition. Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked dominant disorder, which means that females who carry one mutated copy of the FMR1 gene are usually asymptomatic or have milder symptoms compared to males who have only one X chromosome. Therefore, if the woman has a male child, there is a 50% chance that he will inherit the mutated gene and be affected by Fragile X syndrome. On the other hand, if she has a female child, there is also a 50% chance that she will inherit the mutated gene, but as a carrier, she will not typically manifest the clinical symptoms of the disease. This information should be conveyed to the woman as part of genetic and reproductive counseling. It is also important to discuss the option of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for couples at risk of transmitting genetic disorders to their offspring. PGD allows for the screening of embryos created through in vitro fertilization (IVF) for specific genetic mutations, including those associated with Fragile X syndrome.

Taking into account the most probable diagnosis in the clinical picture described, what is the complementary test of choice to confirm this clinical diagnosis?  The clinical picture described suggests a condition known as pyloric stenosis. This is characterized by projectile vomiting, hunger, and normal physical examination findings.

The most appropriate approach in this case is:  The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with erythema nodosum, a cutaneous manifestation often associated with inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease. The appearance of painful, red, purplish nodules on the shins, along with an increase in bowel movements and abdominal pain, suggests a flare-up of the underlying disease.

At present, Maria wants to become pregnant and wants to know the risk of transmitting the disease to her offspring. With the data collected, what is the probability that Maria is a carrier of Duchenne disease?  Since Duchenne disease is an X-linked recessive disease, the sons of an affected father will not have the disease but all daughters of an affected father will be carriers. Elizabeth, being the sister of an affected individual, has a 50% chance of being a carrier since their mother could be either a carrier or not. Since Mary is healthy, she is an obligate carrier.

State your proposed treatment to achieve fertility:  The patient's presentation of hyposmia, lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics, and infertility, along with the analytical findings of low testosterone and LH levels, suggests a diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in the production of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) by the pituitary gland, leading to decreased testosterone production and impaired spermatogenesis.  To achieve fertility in this patient, the underlying cause of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism needs to be addressed. One possible treatment option is the use of a GnRH infusion pump. This method involves the pulsatile administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which mimics the physiological secretion pattern of GnRH and stimulates the production of LH and FSH.  By restoring the pulsatile secretion of GnRH, the normal production of gonadotropins can be reestablished, leading to increased testosterone production and the resumption of spermatogenesis. This can ultimately lead to the development of secondary sexual characteristics and fertility in the patient.

What attitude do you think is correct?  Given the patient's progressive lymphocytosis with a predominance of mature lymphocytes expressing CD5/CD19/CD23 antigens, along with a high leukocyte count and normal hemoglobin and platelet levels, the most appropriate step is to perform a bone aspirate/biopsy. This procedure is crucial for confirming the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is suggested by the peripheral blood findings. CLL is a clonal B-cell disorder characterized by the presence of CD5-positive B lymphocytes, and bone marrow biopsy is necessary to assess the bone marrow involvement and establish a definitive diagnosis. Additionally, this procedure can provide valuable prognostic information, such as the presence of TP53 mutations, which can influence treatment decisions. PET/CT may be considered later to assess the extent of the disease, but it is not the initial step.

In view of these data, what is the most likely diagnosis?  Dementia due to Lewy bodies should be considered as the most likely diagnosis because the patient presents cognitive impairment, slowness and clumsiness of movements, and visual hallucinations, which are characteristic features of this condition. Additionally, the worsening of motor status after the administration of risperidone is consistent with a medication-induced complication known as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which is more likely to occur in patients with Dementia due to Lewy bodies. This diagnosis is supported by the presence of cognitive impairment, motor symptoms resembling parkinsonism, and visual hallucinations, along with the adverse reaction to risperidone.", "options": {"1": "Dementia due to Lewy bodies.", "2": "Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.", "3": "Frontotemporal dementia.", "4": "Alzheimer's disease.", "5": "Vascular dementia."}, "correct_option": 1}

The most reasonable diagnostic suspicion in this case is bacterial meningitis. This is because the clinical presentation of fever, irritability, bulging fontanel, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study showing pleocytosis (elevated cell count), elevated protein levels, and low glucose levels are indicative of bacterial infection in the CSF. These findings are typical for bacterial meningitis, which can cause significant inflammation and potential damage to the central nervous system. Viral meningitis, while also presenting with pleocytosis, typically has lower protein levels and normal glucose levels. Tuberculous meningitis may present with lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, but the glucose level is usually very low. Mononucleosis syndrome and Guillain-Barre syndrome do not typically present with these specific CSF findings. Therefore, based on the clinical and CSF findings, bacterial meningitis is the most likely diagnosis.", "options": {"1": "Viral meningitis.", "2": "Bacterial meningitis.", "3": "Guillain-Barre syndrome.", "4": "Tuberculous meningitis.", "5": "Mononucleosis syndrome."}, "correct_option": 4}

A complete blood count is normal and proteinuria is negative. What type of hypertension does she have?  The correct diagnosis is chronic hypertension. This is because the patient has a high blood pressure reading on two occasions, which is not associated with proteinuria or other symptoms of pre-eclampsia. Additionally, the blood pressure readings are not significantly different from the initial reading after rest, indicating that this is not an acute condition related to pregnancy.

Which of the following is the best therapeutic approach?  The best therapeutic approach for an 85-year-old man presenting with acute arterial insufficiency of the lower limb, evidenced by pain, coldness, cyanosis, and absence of distal pulses, is urgent surgical treatment by thromboembolectomy. This is because the clinical presentation suggests an acute occlusion, likely due to a thromboembolic event, which requires prompt restoration of blood flow to prevent permanent damage and limb loss.

The correct approach in this case is to perform a cranial CT scan to rule out hemorrhagic lesions or other contraindications, and if none are found, start immediate intravenous thrombolysis. This is because the patient presents with acute onset aphasia and right hemiparesis, which are indicative of an ischemic stroke. The CT scan is crucial to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, as the treatment for these two types of strokes differs.

The clinical picture of jaundice, choluria, acholia, and pruritus, with increased direct bilirubin and normal liver on ultrasound, suggests an obstructive etiology. The absence of abdominal pain, weight loss, and dilated bile ducts makes acute cholangitis due to biliary mud less likely. Toxic hepatitis due to ibuprofen is also unlikely given the absence of symptoms such as abdominal pain or eosinophilia. Cholangiocarcinoma is a possibility but would typically present with more symptoms and signs of obstruction.

The most reasonable therapeutic modification to achieve blood pressure control in this 87-year-old man would be to change ibuprofen to paracetamol. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can attenuate the antihypertensive effect of thiazide diuretics, which the patient is already taking. Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a safer alternative for pain management in patients with hypertension because it does not interfere with the blood pressure-lowering effects of antihypertensive medications.

The most plausible diagnosis is:  The presence of blistering lesions on the dorsum of the hands after sun exposure, along with skin fragility, and histopathological findings of subepidermal blisters with PAS+ deposits in and around the superficial dermal vessels are indicative of Pemphigoid. This condition is characterized by autoantibodies against hemidesmosomes, leading to a separation at the dermo-epidermal junction and the formation of subepidermal blisters. The presence of PAS+ deposits in the dermal vessels is consistent with the immune complex deposits seen in pemphigoid, further supporting this diagnosis.", "options": {"1": "Pemphigoid.", "2": "Porphyria cutanea tarda.", "3": "Pemphigus vulgaris.", "4": "Scalded skin syndrome.", "5": "Familial benign pemphigus."}, "correct_option": 2}

The testicle has not increased in volume and the penis has not increased in size. There is no increase in growth rate in the last year. The bone age is one year older than the chronological age. What is the most likely diagnosis?  Early adrenarche is the most likely diagnosis because it is characterized by the early appearance of pubic or axillary hair without an increase in testicular volume or penile size. This condition is caused by an early rise in adrenal androgens, which leads to the development of secondary sexual characteristics without true central precocious puberty. The bone age being one year older than the chronological age is also consistent with early adrenarche.", "options": {"1": "", "2": "Adrenal tumor.", "3": "Early adrenarche.", "4": "Central precocious puberty.", "5": "Peripheral precocious puberty."}, "correct_option": 3}
{"question": "A 47-year-old man, with a history of a right parotid pleomorphic adenoma, treated with surgery (extrafacial parotidectomy) 6 months ago, who comes to our office for presenting pain with sweating and reddening of the skin in the preauricular region during chewing. Which treatment would be the treatment of choice?  The treatment of choice would be intradermal botulinum toxin injection. This is because the patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of Frey's syndrome, also known as auriculotemporal syndrome, which is characterized by pain, sweating, and reddening of the skin in the preauricular region during chewing. This condition commonly occurs after parotid gland surgery and is caused by aberrant regeneration of parasympathetic fibers. Intradermal botulinum toxin injection is effective in treating this condition by blocking cholinergic secretomotor fibers, thereby reducing sweating and pain. Extended total parotidectomy would not be indicated as it is not a recurrence of the tumor, and broad-spectrum antibiotherapy would not be effective as it is not an infectious condition. Pregabalin could be considered for pain management but would not address the underlying cause of the symptoms.", "options": {"1": "Pregabalin.", "2": "Extended total parotidectomy on suspicion of tumor recurrence.", "3": "Broad-spectrum antibiotherapy.", "4": "Intradermal botulinum toxin injection.", "5": ""}, "correct_option": 4}

After one week of treatment, the patient shows no improvement. What is the next therapeutic measure to be taken?  In the case of a severe flare-up of ulcerative colitis that does not respond to prednisone, the next therapeutic measure to be taken is usually the association of an immunosuppressant such as azathioprine. This is because azathioprine is effective in inducing remission in patients with active disease and has a steroid-sparing effect, allowing for a reduction in the dose of prednisone. This approach is preferred before considering surgery or other biologic therapies, as it can provide long-term disease control without the need for invasive interventions.", "options": {"1": "Emergency subtotal colectomy and in a second time prostectomy and ileoanal reservoir.", "2": "Treatment with etanercept (an anti-TNFa antibody) should be considered.", "3": "Associate mesalazine in doses of 4g per day orally and rectal triamcinolone 1 application every 12 hours.", "4": "Associate an immunosuppressant such as azathioprine.", "5": "Intravenous cyclosporine 2mg/kg."}, "correct_option": 5}

The results of the functional study are cortisol 14 microg/dL, TSH 1.4 microU/ml, T4L 1.2 ng/dL, prolactin 480 microg/L (vn < 15), testosterone 160 ng/dL (vn 300-1200), FSH 1.2 U/I., (vn 5-15) and LH 2 U/L (vn 3-15). What is the initial therapeutic approach?  The initial therapeutic approach for a patient with a pituitary adenoma causing symptoms such as loss of vision and headache, and hormonal imbalances, is typically transsphenoidal surgery. This surgical procedure is the standard of care for symptomatic pituitary adenomas that are causing compression of surrounding structures, such as the optic chiasm in this case. Dopaminergic agonists may be used as an adjunct therapy or in cases where surgery is not possible. External radiotherapy or radiosurgery may be considered if residual or recurrent tumor is present after surgery. Treatment of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with testosterone may be necessary as part of the management of hormonal imbalances associated with the pituitary adenoma.

Which of the following options would you choose?  The correct management for a 45-year-old woman with a cervicovaginal cytology compatible with a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion is a colposcopy with possible biopsy. This is because high-grade lesions have a higher risk of progressing to invasive cancer, and colposcopy allows for a guided biopsy to determine the extent of dysplasia or possible cancer. Repeat cytology in 1 month would not be appropriate as it delays definitive diagnosis and management. Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and ovarian conservation is considered a treatment for cervical cancer, not for high-grade lesions, as it is a more invasive procedure. Fractionated uterine curettage is not indicated in this case as it is a procedure used for evaluating or treating abnormalities of the endometrium, not the cervix.

In the gynecological examination she only shows pain when pressing on the posterior vaginal fornix. Which test do you consider would allow you to reach a diagnosis of certainty of her pathology?  The most likely diagnosis for this patient is endometriosis, which is characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus. This condition can cause dyspareunia, dyschezia, and rectorrhagia, especially during menstruation. The patient's inability to conceive could also be related to endometriosis. While transvaginal ultrasound can help identify ovarian endometriomas, it may not definitively diagnose endometriosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide more detailed images of the pelvic organs and may show signs of endometriosis, but it is not considered the gold standard for diagnosis. The definitive diagnosis of endometriosis is typically made through visual inspection during a surgical procedure. Therefore, the best test to reach a diagnosis of certainty for this patient's pathology would be a diagnostic laparoscopy, which allows direct visualization of the pelvic cavity and identification of endometriotic lesions.", "options": {"1": "Magnetic resonance imaging.", "2": "", "3": "Colonoscopy.", "4": "Transvaginal ultrasound.", "5": "Diagnostic laparoscopy."}, "correct_option": 5}

Indicate the correct course of action.  The presence of a carcinoma in situ limited to the head of the polyp and the absence of other abnormalities in the colonoscopy and CT scan, suggests that the polyp has been completely removed and there is no evidence of invasive cancer.

Of the following, indicate the correct option:  Given the patient's presentation of cyanotic mottled lesions on the toes, history of smoking, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, and imaging findings of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm with mural thrombus, the most appropriate intervention is open surgical repair. This is because the aneurysm is at risk of rupture, which is a life-threatening complication. Open surgical repair involves replacing the aneurysmal segment with a tubular prosthesis and reimplantation of the supra-aortic trunks. This approach is necessary to prevent rupture and to restore proper blood flow. Statin therapy is not sufficient to stabilize the thrombus in this case, and urgent diagnostic aortography is not necessary as the diagnosis has already been made with CT angiography.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is complex focal temporal lobe seizures. This diagnosis is supported by the presence of an ascending epigastric sensation and an unpleasant odor, which are common auras associated with temporal lobe seizures. The stereotyped nature of the episodes, including the sucking movements and repeated opening and closing movements of the left hand, further supports this diagnosis.

She takes 5 medications regularly. Which of the following is most likely to contribute to falls in this patient?  The patient's falls are likely to be multifactorial, but given the medications he is taking, paroxetine is most likely to contribute to falls. Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat depression, but it can also have side effects that increase the risk of falls, such as orthostatic hypotension, sedation, and impaired balance and coordination. The other medications the patient is taking, such as allopurinol, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril, are less likely to directly contribute to falls. Allopurinol is used to treat gout and is not typically associated with an increased risk of falls.

She has lost 3 kg but needs an additional loss of 7 kg more. Given the possibility of adding a drug against obesity, which one would you use to reduce fat absorption?  Orlistat is a medication that inhibits gastric and pancreatic lipases, which leads to a reduction in fat absorption. This can be beneficial in promoting weight loss, especially in patients who are on a low-calorie diet and engaging in regular physical activity.

Which of the following complementary tests should be ordered initially for the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of the patient's disease?  The initial test of choice for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease is the ankle-brachial index. This non-invasive test compares the systolic blood pressure in the arms and ankles to determine the presence and severity of arterial disease in the lower extremities. A normal index is between 1.0 and 1.3, while an index less than 1.0 indicates peripheral arterial disease.

State your proposed treatment to achieve fertility:  The patient's presentation of hyposmia, lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics, and infertility, along with the analytical findings of low testosterone and LH levels, suggests a diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in the production of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) by the pituitary gland, leading to decreased testosterone production and impaired spermatogenesis.  To achieve fertility in this patient, the underlying cause of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism needs to be addressed. One possible treatment option is the use of a GnRH infusion pump. This method involves the pulsatile administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which mimics the physiological secretion pattern of GnRH and stimulates the production of LH and FSH.  By restoring the pulsatile secretion of GnRH, the normal production of gonadotropins can be reestablished, leading to increased testosterone production and the resumption of spermatogenesis. This can ultimately lead to the development of secondary sexual characteristics and fertility in the patient.

The patient maintains good visual acuity. Where would you most likely locate the lesion?  The presence of palpebral ptosis and anisocoria, with the left pupil being smaller than the right, suggests a dysfunction of the oculomotor nerve (III cranial pair), which is responsible for most of the eye movements, including eyelid elevation, and the constriction of the pupil.

Which of the following would be correct next:  In the context of sudden cardiac arrest with a shockable rhythm, after delivery of a defibrillator shock, the next step is to continue with Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) protocol, which includes administration of intravenous antiarrhythmics. Amiodarone is the preferred antiarrhythmic in ACLS for shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The initial dose of intravenous amiodarone for cardiac arrest is 150 mg, which should be given after the shock. Therefore, the correct next step in management for this patient is the administration of 150 mg of intravenous amiodarone.", "options": {"1": "Administer 2 mg of intravenous atropine.", "2": "Administration of 150 mg of intravenous amiodarone.", "3": "Administration of 1 mg of intravenous atropine.", "4": "", "5": "Administration of 300 mg of intravenous amiodarone."}, "correct_option": 5}

The testicle has not increased in volume and the penis has not increased in size. There is no increase in growth rate in the last year. The bone age is one year older than the chronological age. What is the most likely diagnosis?  Early adrenarche is the most likely diagnosis because it is characterized by the early appearance of pubic or axillary hair without an increase in testicular volume or penile size. This condition is caused by an early rise in adrenal androgens, which leads to the development of secondary sexual characteristics without true central precocious puberty.

{"question": "A 47-year-old male patient who consults the emergency department for sudden loss of consciousness Which of the following has a higher diagnostic yield?  Clinical history is crucial in the diagnostic evaluation of a 47-year-old male patient presenting with sudden loss of consciousness. It provides information about any pre-existing medical conditions, medications, recent events, or symptoms that may help identify the cause of the loss of consciousness. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is also important to assess for any cardiac arrhythmias or ischemic changes that could lead to syncope. Holter recording, which is a continuous ECG monitoring over a longer period, can be useful in capturing intermittent arrhythmias that might not be detected on a standard ECG. EEG is typically used to evaluate for seizure disorders, which can also present as loss of consciousness. However, in this scenario, clinical history and ECG are more likely to have a higher diagnostic yield as they can provide immediate and relevant information. Cranial CT scan may be considered if there is suspicion of head trauma or intracranial pathology, but it is not the first-line investigation for syncope. Therefore, clinical history and ECG have a higher diagnostic yield in this patient's case.", "options": {"1": "Electrocardiogram.", "2": "Cranial CT scan.", "3": "EEG.", "4": "Holter recording.", "5": "Clinical history."}, "correct_option": 5}

From the data described, it is an alteration that affects, among other elements, the motor fascicles: cortico-spinal and cortico-nuclear, but at what level of the neuroaxis would the lesion be located?  The lesion would be located in the internal capsule, posterior arm on the right side. This is because the internal capsule contains both cortico-spinal and cortico-nuclear tracts, which are responsible for motor function and innervation of the facial muscles.

After routine control, a persistent blood pressure of 190 and TAD 80 mmHg was observed. What would be the most reasonable therapeutic modification to achieve blood pressure control?  The most reasonable therapeutic modification to achieve blood pressure control in this 87-year-old man would be to change ibuprofen to paracetamol. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can attenuate the antihypertensive effect of thiazide diuretics, which the patient is already taking. Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a safer alternative for pain management in patients with hypertension because it does not interfere with the blood pressure-lowering effects of antihypertensive medications.

Biopsies of the distal esophagus reveal that the normal squamous epithelium has been replaced by intestinal-type columnar epithelium with low-grade dysplasia What is the most appropriate management option for this patient?  The patient's endoscopic findings of mild erosive esophagitis and a columnar squamous junction displaced approximately 7 cm, along with biopsy results showing replacement of normal squamous epithelium with intestinal-type columnar epithelium and low-grade dysplasia, are indicative of Barrett's esophagus. This condition is a known risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given the presence of low-grade dysplasia, the most appropriate management option is periodic surveillance endoscopies and indefinite treatment with PPIs. This approach allows for monitoring of the dysplasia and potential progression to higher grades, while also managing the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with PPIs. Esophagectomy is reserved for cases with high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma, and there is no evidence to support indefinite treatment with high doses of PPIs without endoscopic surveillance in this scenario.", "options": {"1": "Indefinite treatment with high doses of PPI since it has been demonstrated that this prevents the progression of Barrett's esophagus to adenocarcinoma, making endoscopic surveillance unnecessary.", "2": "Periodic surveillance endoscopies and treatment with PPIs for less than 12 weeks, since prolonged treatment is associated with a high risk of gastrinoma development.", "3": "Given that the esophagitis is mild and the dysplasia is low grade, it is advisable to continue treatment with alkalines.", "4": "Esophagectomy.", "5": "Periodic surveillance endoscopies and indefinite treatment with PPI."}, "correct_option": 5}

Laboratory tests showed slight leukocytosis and presence of activated leukocytes, slight thrombopenia and slightly increased transaminases. What would be the most likely diagnosis of this clinical picture?  This clinical picture is consistent with infectious mononucleosis, which is commonly caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The symptoms of high fever, pharyngeal pain, and cervical lymphadenopathy are classic for infectious mononucleosis. The macular skin rash that developed after amoxicillin treatment is known as a morbilliform rash, which is a known adverse drug reaction in patients with infectious mononucleosis. The laboratory findings of slight leukocytosis with activated leukocytes, thrombopenia, and slightly increased transaminases are also typical of infectious mononucleosis.

In this case, the patient is presenting with acute dehydration and orthostatic hypotension, which indicates a significant loss of fluid volume. The elevated serum sodium level suggests a hypertonic dehydration, which occurs when water loss exceeds sodium loss. The initial treatment should aim to restore the fluid volume and correct the electrolyte imbalance. Hypertonic saline (3%) is the most appropriate choice because it helps to rapidly correct the fluid deficit and provides sodium to correct the hypertonicity. The use of 5% glucose along with the hypertonic saline helps to provide additional calories and promote rehydration.

{"question": "45-year-old woman, mother of 3 children, attends an early diagnosis consultation. The cervicovaginal cytology is compatible with a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Which of the following options would you choose?  The correct management for a 45-year-old woman with a cervicovaginal cytology compatible with a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion is a colposcopy with possible biopsy. This is because high-grade lesions have a higher risk of progressing to invasive cancer, and colposcopy allows for a guided biopsy to determine the extent of dysplasia or possible cancer. Repeat cytology in 1 month would not be appropriate as it delays definitive diagnosis and management. Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and ovarian conservation is considered a treatment for cervical cancer, not for high-grade lesions, as it is a more invasive procedure.

What diagnosis would you suggest?  The pleural effusion is classified as exudative due to the pleural protein/serum ratio of 0.8 and pleural LDH/serum ratio of 0.9, which meet the criteria for exudative pleural effusion. The presence of intense lymphocytosis without atypia and mesothelial cells 5% suggests a reactive process.

Indicate the treatment you will propose to achieve fertility:  The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is characterized by low levels of FSH and LH and decreased testosterone. This condition can lead to impaired development of secondary sexual characteristics and infertility. Since the patient has a normal prolactin level, hyperprolactinemia is unlikely to be the cause. The presence of hyposmia suggests an underlying condition affecting the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Therefore, the appropriate treatment to induce gonadal development and achieve fertility would be the administration of GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone), either through an infusion pump or monthly intramuscular injections.

In the case of a 67-year-old woman with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast and no family history of neoplasia, it is recommended to perform a study of hormone receptors and HER2 on the tumor. This is because the presence of hormone receptors (such as estrogen and progesterone receptors) and HER2 can influence treatment decisions and prognosis. Hormone receptor-positive tumors may respond to hormonal therapy, while HER2-positive tumors may benefit from targeted therapy with drugs like trastuzumab.

What would be the interpretation you would make of the arterial blood gas and what treatment would you use?  The patient presents with respiratory acidosis (pH 7.32), hypoxemia (pO2 61 mmHg), and hypercapnia (pCO2 58 mmHg). The respiratory acidosis is due to the inability of the patient to eliminate CO2 adequately. Given the clinical context of increased dyspnea and the blood gas findings, the most appropriate management would be to initiate noninvasive mechanical ventilation.

What is the initial therapeutic approach?  The initial therapeutic approach for a patient with a pituitary adenoma causing symptoms such as loss of vision and headache, and hormonal imbalances, is typically transsphenoidal surgery. This surgical procedure is the standard of care for symptomatic pituitary adenomas that are causing compression of surrounding structures, such as the optic chiasm in this case. Dopaminergic agonists may be used as an adjunct therapy or in cases where surgery is not possible. External radiotherapy or radiosurgery may be considered if residual or recurrent tumor is present after surgery.

Which of the following is the most appropriate approach to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus:  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends confirming the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus by repeating the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test on a subsequent day if the result is 126 mg/dl or higher. Alternatively, a random plasma glucose concentration of 200 mg/dl or higher can be used, along with symptoms of hyperglycemia, to make the diagnosis. A glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value of 6.5% or higher can also be used to confirm the diagnosis. In this case, the patient's FPG levels are 153 mg/dl, 118 mg/dl, and 136 mg/dl, which do not meet the criteria for a definitive diagnosis of diabetes mellitus based on a single test. Therefore, the most appropriate approach to confirm the diagnosis would be to request a determination of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as it provides information about the average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months.

After performing the relevant tests, it was found that the left ventricular ejection fraction was preserved (>50%). With regard to treatment, indicate the CORRECT answer:  Initial treatment for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) should indeed focus on addressing the underlying pathological process, such as managing hypertension or dyslipidemia in this case. This approach aims to optimize the patient's overall cardiovascular health and reduce the workload on the heart. Diuretics may be used judiciously to manage fluid overload and symptoms of congestion, but starting at high doses can lead to electrolyte imbalances and renal dysfunction, so they should be titrated carefully. Nitrate therapy, if necessary, should be initiated cautiously at low doses due to the potential for hypotension and adverse effects on cardiac function. Neurohormonal activation, which contributes to the progression of heart failure, can be reduced with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists, thereby improving symptoms like dyspnea.", "options": {"1": "If nitrate treatment is required, it should be started at low doses.", "2": "", "3": "Initial treatment should be directed to the underlying pathological process.", "4": "Treatment with diuretics should be started at high doses.", "5": "Dyspnea can be treated by reducing neurohormonal activation with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists."}, "correct_option": 4}

She presents with arm pain with swelling and functional impotence of the arm and inability to extend the wrist and fingers. It is most likely to present:  This clinical presentation is consistent with a diaphyseal fracture of the humerus with radial nerve injury. The inability to extend the wrist and fingers suggests a radial nerve injury, which is commonly associated with humeral shaft fractures. The swelling and functional impotence of the arm are indicative of a fracture. The fact that the patient fell on an outstretched hand with the elbow in extension is a typical mechanism of injury for a humeral shaft fracture.", "options": {"1": "Elbow dislocation.", "2": "Dislocation fracture of proximal humerus.", "3": "Diaphyseal fracture of the humerus associated with double forearm fracture.", "4": "", "5": "Diaphyseal fracture of humerus with radial nerve injury."}, "correct_option": 5}

Laboratory tests showed slight leukocytosis and presence of activated leukocytes, slight thrombopenia and slightly increased transaminases. What would be the most likely diagnosis of this clinical picture?  This clinical picture is consistent with infectious mononucleosis, which is commonly caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The symptoms of high fever, pharyngeal pain, and cervical lymphadenopathy are classic for infectious mononucleosis. The macular skin rash that developed after amoxicillin treatment is known as a morbilliform rash, which is a known adverse drug reaction in patients with infectious mononucleosis. The laboratory findings of slight leukocytosis with activated leukocytes, thrombopenia, and slightly increased transaminases are also typical of infectious mononucleosis.

Which of the following options would you choose?  The correct management for a 45-year-old woman with a cervicovaginal cytology compatible with a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion is a colposcopy with possible biopsy. This is because high-grade lesions have a higher risk of progressing to invasive cancer, and colposcopy allows for a guided biopsy to determine the extent of dysplasia or possible cancer. Repeat cytology in 1 month would not be appropriate as it delays definitive diagnosis and management. Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and ovarian conservation is considered a treatment for cervical cancer, not for high-grade lesions, as it is a more invasive procedure. Fractionated uterine curettage is not indicated in this case as it is a procedure used for evaluating or treating abnormalities of the endometrium, not the cervix.

Which option is NOT appropriate for management?  In the case of a 23-month-old boy presenting with fever, hypotension, repeated vomiting, meningeal signs, petechiae, and ecchymosis, along with an altered CBC and coagulation study, the clinical picture is suggestive of sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The management for such a case typically includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and supportive care.

A thoracentesis shows a yellowish fluid with the following features: red blood cells 2000/uL, leukocytes 2500/uL, with 90% lymphocytes, protein 4.9 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 550 U/L, glucose 67 mg/dL, and absence of malignant cells on cytology. Which of the following tests would be most useful in diagnosing the cause of the pleural effusion?  The most useful test for diagnosing the cause of the pleural effusion in this patient would be the measurement of adenosine deaminase (ADA) in pleural fluid. ADA is an enzyme involved in purine metabolism and is commonly used as a diagnostic marker for tuberculous pleuritis. Elevated levels of ADA in pleural fluid are suggestive of tuberculosis, especially in patients from regions where tuberculosis is endemic, such as Cameroon. This test is particularly useful in cases where acid-fast bacilli are not detected on microscopy or culture.

She does not refer trauma or other underlying pathology. In the physical examination there is no neurological deficit. Which imaging test would be indicated?  In a patient with a first episode of low back pain without any neurological deficit or underlying pathology, the initial imaging test of choice would be an MRI. This is because MRI provides more detailed information about the soft tissues, including the intervertebral discs, and can help identify herniations or other abnormalities that may not be evident on a plain X-ray or CT scan. Additionally, MRI is preferred over CT scan as it does not involve ionizing radiation, which is particularly important if the patient is of childbearing age or if repeated imaging is anticipated.

Which of the following immunological studies should we request:  Given the patient's history of recurrent pneumonias and current diarrheal syndrome, it is important to assess his immune function to identify any underlying immunodeficiency. The best initial test would be a serum immunoglobulin count and antibody production capacity test. This test will determine the levels of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM) and evaluate the patient's ability to produce antibodies in response to an antigenic challenge. Recurrent infections can be indicative of an antibody deficiency disorder, which can be diagnosed with this test. Phagocytosis test and oxidative metabolism of neutrophils would be more relevant in cases of suspected innate immune defects, such as chronic granulomatous disease. Apoptosis test (programmed cell death) in circulating lymphocytes is not directly related to the patient's symptoms. Study of the repertoire and clonality of T lymphocytes (alpha/beta) could be considered if a T-cell immunodeficiency is suspected, but it is not the first-line test in this scenario.

Indicate which would be the best recommendation to establish the etiological diagnosis of the patient's condition:  The presence of conjunctival jaundice, pruritus, asthenia, dry mouth, and absence of lacrimation, along with elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels, suggests a cholestatic liver disease. The non-painful hepatomegaly and the absence of a history of alcohol consumption or hepatotoxic drug use make alcoholic liver disease and drug-induced liver injury unlikely. The combination of these clinical findings and laboratory results is highly suggestive of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a chronic autoimmune cholestatic liver disease that primarily affects women.

Which of the following is the most plausible cause of her headache?  The most plausible cause of the woman's headache is tension. This is because tension headaches are characterized by a constant, dull pain that can spread across the head and is often described as a feeling of tightness or pressure. They are not typically relieved by paracetamol and can be triggered or worsened by stress. Migraines, while they also cause severe headaches, often present with additional symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound, which were not mentioned in the case.

What attitude do you think is correct?  Given the patient's progressive lymphocytosis with a predominance of mature lymphocytes expressing CD5/CD19/CD23 antigens, along with a high leukocyte count and normal hemoglobin and platelet levels, the most appropriate step is to perform a bone aspirate/biopsy. This procedure is crucial for confirming the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is suggested by the peripheral blood findings. CLL is a clonal B-cell disorder characterized by the presence of CD5-positive B lymphocytes, and bone marrow biopsy is necessary to assess the bone marrow involvement and establish a definitive diagnosis. Additionally, this procedure can provide valuable prognostic information, such as the presence of TP53 mutations, which can influence treatment decisions.

Which of the following is a poor prognostic factor after surgical resection and should be taken into account when planning chemotherapy treatment?  The size of the primary lesion and histological differentiation are important factors to consider when planning chemotherapy treatment for adenocarcinoma of the sigma. Tumors with larger size and poorer histological differentiation tend to have a worse prognosis and may require more aggressive treatment. Anemia at diagnosis is also a poor prognostic factor, as it can indicate chronic bleeding from the tumor and therefore a more advanced stage of disease.

{"question": "A 76-year-old man consults for cognitive impairment, slowness and clumsiness of movements, of eight months of evolution. The family reports that the patient had visual hallucinations, so his primary care physician prescribed low doses of risperidone, with a significant worsening of motor status. In view of these data, what is the most likely diagnosis?  Dementia due to Lewy bodies should be considered as the most likely diagnosis because the patient presents cognitive impairment, slowness and clumsiness of movements, and visual hallucinations, which are characteristic features of this condition. Additionally, the worsening of motor status after the administration of risperidone is consistent with a medication-induced complication known as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which is more likely to occur in patients with Dementia due to Lewy bodies. This diagnosis is supported by the presence of cognitive impairment, motor symptoms resembling parkinsonism, and visual hallucinations, along with the adverse reaction to risperidone.", "options": {"1": "Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.", "2": "Alzheimer's disease.", "3": "Vascular dementia.", "4": "Frontotemporal dementia.", "5": "Dementia due to Lewy bodies."}, "correct_option": 5}

He was admitted to the hospital for suspected myasthenic crisis and treatment was started. The next day the patient alerts at 03 hours in the morning because the patient makes a strange noise when breathing in, like a soft snoring, the patient is sound asleep and very sweaty, but does not seem to be fatigued. What is the most correct attitude?  Given the patient's history of myasthenia gravis and current symptoms of mild difficulty in swallowing and evening diplopia, along with the new onset of a snoring-like noise during inhalation while asleep, the most appropriate action would be to notify intensive care for suspected acute respiratory failure. This is because the snoring noise could indicate upper airway obstruction, which is a potential sign of respiratory distress in a patient with a neuromuscular disorder like myasthenia gravis. It is important to assess the patient for possible orotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation to ensure adequate respiratory support.

After routine control, a persistent blood pressure of 190 and TAD 80 mmHg was observed. What would be the most reasonable therapeutic modification to achieve blood pressure control?  The most reasonable therapeutic modification to achieve blood pressure control in this 87-year-old man would be to change ibuprofen for paracetamol. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can attenuate the antihypertensive effects of perindopril, a angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and thiazide diuretics. Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a safer alternative for pain control in patients with hypertension as it does not interfere with the antihypertensive action of these medications.

The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is temporal arteritis, which is an inflammatory condition of the blood vessels, particularly the temporal arteries. This condition can lead to sudden and painless vision loss due to ischemia of the optic nerve. The symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, muscle and joint pain are also consistent with temporal arteritis.

Which clinical elements would NOT be important in determining that she is at high clinical risk for pulmonary thromboembolism?  In determining the high clinical risk for pulmonary thromboembolism in this 59-year-old woman, her history of osteoporosis would not be considered an important clinical element. This is because osteoporosis itself does not directly increase the risk of developing a pulmonary embolism. However, other factors such as a history of breast cancer, prolonged immobility (more than 3 days), and the presence of unilateral calf edema and pain on palpation are significant clinical elements that increase the suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism. These factors are associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE), where cancer and its treatment, immobilization, and signs of deep vein thrombosis (such as calf edema and pain) are well-established risk factors for developing pulmonary embolism.", "options": {"1": "Presence of unilateral edema of the right calf.", "2": "History of having been at rest for more than 3 days.", "3": "History of osteoporosis.", "4": "History of breast cancer.", "5": ""}, "correct_option": 3}

We should make a differential diagnosis between the following clinical situations EXCEPT:  The levels of FSH and LH in the woman's hormonal study are significantly lower than the normal range for the follicular phase. This indicates a state of hypogonadism, which can be caused by various factors. However, hyperprolactinemia is not listed as an option, and it is a condition that can also lead to decreased levels of FSH and LH due to the inhibitory effect of prolactin on the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.

The patient maintains good visual acuity, where would you most likely locate the lesion?  The symptoms described, including palpebral ptosis of the left eye, anisocoria with the left pupil being smaller than the right, and gait instability, suggest a lesion in the oculomotor nerve (III cranial nerve). This nerve is responsible for controlling most of the muscles that move the eyeball and also controls the muscles that control eyelid movement.

Given the patient's family history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most appropriate attitude or test to recommend for the 34-year-old brother, who is unaware of his disease status, would be a screening test to assess for the presence of the disease. ADPKD is a hereditary disorder characterized by the development of multiple cysts in the kidneys and other organs. It is typically diagnosed using imaging studies that can visualize the presence of kidney cysts. Among the options provided, an abdomino-pelvic ultrasound would be the most suitable initial screening test for this individual. It is non-invasive, widely available, and highly sensitive in detecting kidney cysts, which would help determine whether the brother has inherited the disease or not. Genetic mutational and linkage studies, while useful for confirming a diagnosis and determining the specific gene mutation, are not the first-line screening tests for ADPKD.

What attitude do you think is correct?  Given the patient's progressive lymphocytosis with a predominance of mature lymphocytes expressing CD5/CD19/CD23 antigens, along with a high leukocyte count and normal hemoglobin and platelet levels, the most appropriate step is to perform a bone aspirate/biopsy. This procedure is crucial for confirming the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is suggested by the peripheral blood findings. CLL is a clonal B-cell disorder characterized by the presence of CD5-positive B lymphocytes, and bone marrow biopsy is necessary to assess the bone marrow involvement and establish a definitive diagnosis. Additionally, this procedure can provide valuable prognostic information, such as the presence of TP53 mutations, which can influence treatment decisions.

Which of these diagnoses do you think is the most likely to be found in the biopsy?   The patient presents with proteinuria, hematuria, and low levels of C3 and C4, which are indicative of immune complex deposition in the glomeruli. This, along with the absence of significant findings on physical examination and negative results for antiDNA, ANCA, antiMBG, and rheumatoid factor, suggests a primary glomerular disease rather than a systemic disease. Among the given options, membranous glomerulonephritis is the most likely diagnosis to be found in the renal biopsy. It is characterized by the deposition of immune complexes along the glomerular basement membrane, leading to proteinuria and hematuria.

In the following weeks he has had two other baseline blood glucose readings of 118 and 136 mg/dl. Which of the following is the most appropriate approach to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus:  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends confirming the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus by repeating the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test on a subsequent day if the result is 126 mg/dl or higher. Alternatively, a random plasma glucose concentration of 200 mg/dl or higher can be used, along with symptoms of hyperglycemia, to make the diagnosis. A glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value of 6.5% or higher can also be used to confirm the diagnosis. In this case, the patient's FPG levels are 153 mg/dl, 118 mg/dl, and 136 mg/dl, which do not meet the criteria for a definitive diagnosis of diabetes mellitus based on a single test. Therefore, the most appropriate approach to confirm the diagnosis would be to request a determination of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as it provides information about the average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months.

What approach would you recommend?  The recommended approach for a 32-year-old asymptomatic woman with a 4cm uterine myoma who wishes to become pregnant is attempting pregnancy without any previous treatment. This is because uterine myomas are common and often do not interfere with pregnancy. The myoma in this case does not deform the endometrial cavity, which is a critical factor in determining the need for intervention. Treatment for myomas, such as myomectomy or embolization, is typically reserved for cases where the myoma causes symptoms or significantly affects the chances of conception or pregnancy outcomes.

The patient is referred to the genetic counseling office where a possible chorionic villus biopsy to study the fetal genotype is evaluated. Is this invasive procedure indicated as a pre-natal diagnosis (PND) in this case?  The invasive procedure of chorionic villus biopsy for pre-natal diagnosis (PND) is indicated after studying the Consultant's genotype and only if it is heterozygous. This is because SCA3 ataxia is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that if the Consultant is a carrier (heterozygous), there is a 50% chance of transmitting the mutation to the fetus. In such cases, PND can provide valuable information to the parents regarding the fetal genotype and allow them to make informed decisions about the pregnancy.

What specific treatment do you consider most appropriate?  In cases of smoke inhalation, where polyurethane foams are involved, the patient may have been exposed to cyanide, a byproduct of the combustion of these materials. Cyanide inhibits cytochrome oxidase in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leading to cellular hypoxia and increased lactic acid production, as evidenced by the elevated capillary lactic acid level.

What is the most appropriate treatment?  The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with vasomotor symptoms, such as restlessness, heat, and palpitations, which are common in menopause. The analytical analysis shows a significant decrease in estradiol levels, which is indicative of hypoestrogenism. The most appropriate treatment for alleviating these symptoms in menopausal women with hypoestrogenism is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Among the given options, the best choice for HRT in this patient is transdermal estrogens in a continuous regimen. This route of administration bypasses the liver, reducing the risk of thromboembolic events, and provides a more consistent level of estrogen, which can effectively relieve vasomotor symptoms.", "options": {"1": "Oral estrogens and progestogens in continuous regimen.", "2": "", "3": "Vaginal estrogens.", "4": "Transdermal estrogens in a continuous regimen.", "5": "Benzodiazepines."}, "correct_option": 4}

The patient's history of being an ex-smoker and the presence of multiple metastases on the CT scan suggest that the primary site of cancer is likely to be in the lungs. This is because lung cancer has a high propensity to spread to the brain, and the patient's smoking history increases the risk of lung cancer.", "options": {"1": "Head and neck cancer.", "2": "Urinary bladder cancer.", "3": "Colon cancer.", "4": "Lung cancer.", "5": "Pancreatic cancer."}, "correct_option": 4}
{"question": "A 43-year-old male with no past history of interest consults for a ten-day history of jaundice of the skin and mucous membranes, choluria and acholia.

She does not take any medication except occasional ibuprofen for muscle pain after sports activities. The CBC shows increased bilirubin at the expense of direct bilirubin. An urgent ultrasound shows a normal liver, vesicular cholesterosis and absence of bile duct dilatation, with no other alterations of interest. What is the most likely diagnosis?  The clinical picture of jaundice, choluria, acholia, and pruritus, with increased direct bilirubin and normal liver on ultrasound, suggests an obstructive etiology. The absence of abdominal pain, weight loss, and dilated bile ducts makes acute cholangitis due to biliary mud less likely. Toxic hepatitis due to ibuprofen is also unlikely given the absence of symptoms such as abdominal pain or eosinophilia. Cholangiocarcinoma is a possibility but would typically present with more symptoms and signs of obstruction. Gilbert's syndrome is characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and would not explain the choluria or acholia. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary sclerosing cholangitis, which can present with similar symptoms and requires further investigation with imaging of the biliary tree.", "options": {"1": "", "2": "Gilbert's syndrome.", "3": "Acute cholangitis due to biliary mud.", "4": "Cholangiocarcinoma.", "5": "Toxic hepatitis due to ibuprofen."}, "correct_option": 5}

He had a colonoscopy three years ago in which diverticula were reported along the entire colon, more numerous in the left colon, with no other associated lesions. Which of the following would be the best approach to follow?  The patient's symptoms suggest a possible acute diverticulitis, characterized by abdominal pain in the left iliac fossa, diarrhea, and no evidence of infection or peritoneal irritation. Given the absence of alarming signs and the previous knowledge of diverticulosis, the best approach would be to initiate empirical treatment with antibiotics to cover common bacteria associated with diverticular disease, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli. This treatment aims to reduce inflammation and prevent complications. A colonoscopy could be considered after symptom resolution to reassess the colon and rule out other associated lesions.

The ABG results show a decreased pH indicating acidosis, an increased PCO2 indicating respiratory acidosis, and a relatively normal PO2. These findings are consistent with alveolar hypoventilation, which is characterized by inadequate alveolar ventilation leading to an increase in PCO2 and subsequent respiratory acidosis. Lobar pneumonia and bronchopneumonia typically present with localized findings such as cough, sputum production, and focal infiltrates on chest x-ray.

On this basis, what is the most effective treatment to slow the progression of the patient's type 2 diabetic nephropathy?  Angiotensin receptor blockers are the most effective treatment to slow the progression of type 2 diabetic nephropathy.

She does not refer trauma or other underlying pathology. In the physical examination there is no neurological deficit. Which imaging test would be indicated?  In a patient with a first episode of low back pain without any neurological deficit or underlying pathology, the initial imaging test of choice would be an MRI. This is because MRI provides more detailed information about the soft tissues, including the intervertebral discs, and can help identify herniations or other abnormalities that may not be evident on a plain X-ray or CT scan.

In the case of a severe flare-up of ulcerative colitis that does not respond to prednisone, the next therapeutic measure to be taken is usually the association of an immunosuppressant such as azathioprine. This is because azathioprine is effective in inducing remission in patients with active disease and has a steroid-sparing effect, allowing for a reduction in the dose of prednisone.

Endoscopic ultrasound and PET-CT scan were requested where no pathological lymphadenopathies were observed. Which of the following options would be the most correct?   In this case, the most correct option would be Chemotherapy plus preoperative radiotherapy. This is because squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is highly sensitive to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Preoperative chemoradiation can significantly reduce the size of the tumor, making it more resectable and potentially increasing the chances of achieving clear surgical margins. Additionally, this approach aims to treat any microscopic metastatic disease that may not be detected on imaging, thereby improving overall survival rates. The choice of transhiatal esophagectomy or esophagectomy according to the Ivor-Lewis technique would depend on the location and extent of the tumor, as well as other patient-specific factors, following the completion of neoadjuvant therapy.

After routine control, a persistent blood pressure of 190 and TAD 80 mmHg was observed. What would be the most reasonable therapeutic modification to achieve blood pressure control?  The most reasonable therapeutic modification to achieve blood pressure control in this 87-year-old man would be to change ibuprofen to paracetamol. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can attenuate the antihypertensive effect of thiazide diuretics, which the patient is already taking. Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a safer alternative for pain management in patients with hypertension because it does not interfere with the blood pressure-lowering effects of antihypertensive medications.

Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor that can cause angioedema, which is characterized by swelling of the deeper layers of the skin and mucous membranes. Angioedema can occur in the absence of urticaria and can be life-threatening if it affects the airways. In this case, the patient does not have a history of drug or food allergy, which makes enalapril the most likely cause of the angioedema.", "options": {"1": "Enalapril.", "2": "Levodopa.", "3": "Metformin or levodopa equally.", "4": "", "5": "Simvastatin."}, "correct_option": 1}
{"question": "An 80-year-old woman comes to the emergency room with abdominal pain starting in the epigastrium and radiating later to the left iliac fossa. An abdominal CT scan is performed, showing inflammation in the walls of the sigma and mesenteric abscess of 2 cm. The treatment of choice is:  The patient is presenting with symptoms indicative of diverticulitis, which is characterized by inflammation of the diverticula in the colon. The CT scan findings of inflammation in the walls of the sigma and a 2 cm mesenteric abscess are consistent with this diagnosis. In the case of diverticulitis with abscess formation, the treatment of choice is typically percutaneous drainage, which can be performed laparoscopically. This minimally invasive approach allows for the drainage of the abscess and often resolves the infection without the need for more extensive surgical intervention. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient would be laparoscopic drainage.", "options": {"1": "Discharge colostomy.", "2": "Drainage by laparoscopic surgery.", "3": "", "4": "Admission to the ward with absolute diet and broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment.", "5": "Urgent surgery with sigmoidectomy and colorectal anastomosis."}, "correct_option": 4}

What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?  The most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform in this case is a spiral CT with contrast. This imaging modality is ideal for visualizing the urinary tract and can help identify the presence of kidney stones, which could be causing the patient's symptoms. Additionally, a spiral CT can provide information about the size, location, and number of stones, as well as any complications such as hydronephrosis or pyelonephritis. Given the patient's history of uric lithiasis and the new onset of AF, ruling out renal pathology as a potential cause is crucial, and a spiral CT with contrast is the best initial step for this purpose.", "options": {"1": "Plain abdominal x-ray.", "2": "Intravenous urography.", "3": "Doppler ultrasound.", "4": "Spiral CT with contrast.", "5": "Abdominal ultrasound."}, "correct_option": 4}

A complete blood count is normal and proteinuria is negative. What type of hypertension does she have?  The correct diagnosis is chronic hypertension. This is because the patient has a high blood pressure reading on two occasions, which is not associated with proteinuria or other symptoms of pre-eclampsia. Additionally, the blood pressure readings are not significantly different from the initial reading after rest, indicating that this is not an acute condition related to pregnancy.

He is ashamed of his appearance, so he does not want to go out, he gets very anxious when he sees his image and he cannot stop thinking about his deformity all day long. He has consulted several maxillofacial surgeons but they tell him that he does not have facial asymmetry and refer him to a psychiatrist. The patient's diagnosis is:  The patient's symptoms are indicative of body dysmorphic disorder. This condition is characterized by an excessive preoccupation or obsession with one's physical appearance, specifically with perceived defects or flaws that are not observable or appear minor to others. In this case, the patient is fixated on his jaw and facial asymmetry, which leads to significant distress, including social withdrawal and anxiety.

Hemogram, renal and hepatic function are normal. Prothrombin time 90%, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio of 2 to control (N <1.2). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  The most likely diagnosis is pulmonary embolism. This is supported by the dyspneic sensation, rhythmic tachycardia, normal pulmonary auscultation, and the presence of a pO2 of 70 mmHg and a pCO2 of 32 mmHg which are indicative of respiratory distress. The prolonged APTT ratio of 2 suggests a possible coagulopathy, which can be associated with pulmonary embolism.

A week after her discharge, she suddenly feels short of breath, which leads her to consult her family doctor who notices that her right calf has edema and pain on palpation. Which clinical elements would NOT be important in determining that she is at high clinical risk for pulmonary thromboembolism?  In determining the high clinical risk for pulmonary thromboembolism in this 59-year-old woman, her history of osteoporosis would not be considered an important clinical element. This is because osteoporosis itself does not directly increase the risk of developing a pulmonary embolism. However, other factors such as a history of breast cancer, prolonged immobility (more than 3 days), and the presence of unilateral calf edema and pain on palpation are significant clinical elements that increase the suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism. These factors are associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE), where cancer and its treatment, immobilization, and signs of deep vein thrombosis (such as calf edema and pain) are well-established risk factors for developing pulmonary embolism.", "options": {"1": "History of having been at rest for more than 3 days.", "2": "", "3": "History of breast cancer.", "4": "Presence of unilateral edema of the right calf.", "5": "History of osteoporosis."}, "correct_option": 5}

The ECG showed complete atrioventricular block. What is the most probable cause of this clinical situation?  The most probable cause of the complete atrioventricular block in this clinical scenario is the pharmacodynamic interaction between beta-blocker (atenolol), digoxin, and verapamil. These drugs have a combined effect of slowing down the heart rate and increasing the refractory period of the atrioventricular node, which can lead to a complete block.

On examination, there is good peripheral perfusion of the right foot, but the patient has a decreased pedal pulse. Which of the following complementary tests should be ordered initially for the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of the patient's disease?  The initial test of choice for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease is the ankle-brachial index. This non-invasive test compares the systolic blood pressure in the arms and ankles to determine the presence and severity of arterial disease in the lower extremities. A normal index is between 1.0 and 1.3, while an index less than 1.0 indicates peripheral arterial disease. An index of 0.9 or greater suggests that the patient may have calcified vessels, which could give a falsely elevated reading.

Which of the following features associated with headache seems most likely in this patient?  The most likely feature associated with the headache in this patient is a predominance in the morning. This is because the patient has a right hemispheric mass with edema, midline deviation, and signs of tentorial herniation, which can cause increased intracranial pressure.

He was infused with 20 ml/kg of crystalloids. During his transfer to the hospital his vital signs improve transiently and then deteriorate on arrival at the hospital. Point out the correct answer:  Given the patient's initial presentation with signs of hypovolemic shock (pale, sweaty, thready pulse, low blood pressure) that transiently improves after crystalloid infusion but then deteriorates, it is indicative of ongoing bleeding or inadequate resuscitation. The best step is to prepare for a possible blood transfusion with crossmatching tests, as the patient may require blood transfusion based on further assessment and laboratory results.

What is the most probable diagnosis?  The symptoms of abdominal distension, diarrhea, refusal to feed, peribuccal erythema, and vomiting after feeding, along with a family history of celiac disease, are suggestive of an immune-mediated reaction to gluten ingestion. The onset of symptoms coincides with the introduction of cereals containing gluten, which is consistent with celiac disease.

This risk is higher in patients with extensive colitis, like pancolitis, and in those with a longer duration of the disease. Although the risk decreases in patients in long-term remission, it does not return to the baseline risk of the general population. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with ulcerative colitis undergo regular colonoscopy screening with multiple biopsies at different locations in the colon.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is complex focal temporal lobe seizures. This diagnosis is supported by the presence of an ascending epigastric sensation and an unpleasant odor, which are common auras associated with temporal lobe seizures. The stereotyped nature of the episodes, including the sucking movements and repeated opening and closing movements of the left hand, further supports this diagnosis.

A complete blood test showed proteinuria of 8 g/day without microhematuria, hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia with normal renal function. He was empirically administered corticosteroids. After one month, the clinical picture has completely disappeared. What is your diagnostic hypothesis?  The clinical picture of edema, proteinuria of 8 g/day without microhematuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia, along with a complete response to corticosteroids, is indicative of nephropathy with minimal changes. This condition, also known as minimal change disease, is characterized by the absence of significant glomerular abnormalities on microscopy and is responsive to corticosteroid therapy. The presence of normal renal function and the absence of other findings such as amyloid deposits or IgA deposits, which are seen in amyloidosis and IgA nephropathy respectively, support the diagnosis of nephropathy with minimal changes.

His physician gave him dietary recommendations, the convenience of physical exercise, and he started treatment with metformin 850 mg/12 hours and glimepiride 6 mg/day. In the following weeks the glycemic controls are progressively reduced. At 4 months glycemia is 94 mg/dL and HbA1c is 5.9%. The patient complains of frequent episodes of dizziness, epigastric pain, blurred vision, sweating and tremor, which improve with food and occur mainly in the late morning and late afternoon. What modification would you propose in his treatment?  The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, which are likely due to the sulfonylurea (glimepiride) stimulating insulin release from the pancreas. These symptoms typically occur when the patient's blood sugar drops too low, especially during periods of fasting or exercise. To address this, it would be appropriate to review the timing and distribution of the patient's carbohydrate intake, ensuring that they have a balanced diet with adequate carbohydrates throughout the day. This could involve adjusting the timing of meals or snacks to prevent large dips in blood sugar levels.

What approach would you recommend?  The recommended approach for a 32-year-old asymptomatic woman with a 4cm uterine myoma who wishes to become pregnant is attempting pregnancy without any previous treatment. This is because uterine myomas are common and often do not interfere with pregnancy. The myoma in this case does not deform the endometrial cavity, which is a critical factor in determining the need for intervention. Treatment for myomas, such as myomectomy or embolization, is typically reserved for cases where the myoma causes symptoms or significantly affects the chances of conception or pregnancy outcomes.

The presence of acute leukemia with t(15;17) translocation in 60% of the cells indicates acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is a subtype of myeloblastic leukemia type M3. APL is characterized by the presence of the PML-RARA fusion gene, which is targeted by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). ATRA, along with arsenic trioxide, is the standard treatment for APL and has significantly improved the prognosis for patients with this subtype of leukemia.

The correct management for a 45-year-old woman with a cervicovaginal cytology compatible with a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion is a colposcopy with possible biopsy. This is because high-grade lesions have a higher risk of progressing to invasive cancer, and colposcopy allows for a guided biopsy to determine the extent of dysplasia or possible cancer. Repeat cytology in 1 month would not be appropriate as it delays definitive diagnosis and management. Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and ovarian conservation is considered a treatment for cervical cancer, not for high-grade lesions, as it is a more invasive procedure.

State your proposed treatment to achieve fertility:  The patient's presentation of hyposmia, lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics, and infertility, along with the analytical findings of low testosterone and LH levels, suggests a diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in the production of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) by the pituitary gland, leading to decreased testosterone production and impaired spermatogenesis.  To achieve fertility in this patient, the underlying cause of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism needs to be addressed. One possible treatment option is the use of a GnRH infusion pump. This method involves the pulsatile administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which mimics the physiological secretion pattern of GnRH and stimulates the production of LH and FSH.  By restoring the pulsatile secretion of GnRH, the normal production of gonadotropins can be reestablished, leading to increased testosterone production and the resumption of spermatogenesis. This can ultimately lead to the development of secondary sexual characteristics and fertility in the patient.

In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, left bundle branch block, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 26%, the implantation of a cardiac resynchronization system is recommended to improve symptoms and survival. This is because these patients often have evidence of electrical dyssynchrony, which can be corrected by a biventricular pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, leading to improved cardiac function and quality of life. Surgical coronary revascularization is not indicated as there is no mention of coronary artery disease.

The correct order of drug administration in the case of anaphylaxis, as per international guidelines, is intramuscular adrenaline first, followed by an inhaled bronchodilator of the SABA type and then intramuscular dexchlorpheniramine. This order is based on the immediate need to reverse the life-threatening effects of anaphylaxis with adrenaline, followed by bronchodilation to relieve bronchospasm, and finally an antihistamine to reduce urticaria and other allergic symptoms. Serum tryptase is a laboratory test that can be requested for further evaluation of anaphylaxis, as elevated levels can indicate mast cell activation, which is a key feature of anaphylaxis.

On examination there is no evidence of strength deficits or sensory deficits in the extremities or speech or language disorders. In this case, which of the following statements is correct?  The most probable diagnosis is a demyelinating plaque in the contralateral hemiprotuberance, the most necessary complementary exploration would be a cranial MRI. This is because the symptoms described, including weakness in the right half of the face, dysgeusia, hyperacusis, and ipsilateral mastoid pain, suggest a lesion in the brainstem or cerebellum, which is consistent with multiple sclerosis.

Which of the following drugs would you use in the first line for the treatment of her pathology?  The first-line treatment for neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy includes medications that modulate pain perception and neuronal transmission. Duloxetine, a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is effective in reducing neuropathic pain by increasing the availability of these neurotransmitters in the central nervous system.

A complete blood count is normal and proteinuria is negative. What type of hypertension is present?  Chronic hypertension is diagnosed when a blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg is identified before pregnancy or before 20 weeks of gestation, without the presence of proteinuria. In this case, the patient has a blood pressure of 160/105 mmHg at 10 weeks of pregnancy, and after 4 hours of rest, the blood pressure remains elevated at 150/95 mmHg. Additionally, the absence of proteinuria helps to rule out preeclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension.

{"question": "A 72-year-old man, ex-smoker, hypertensive and diabetic. History of stroke with residual paresis in the left arm 4 months ago. He comes to the emergency department of a regional hospital with intense precordial pain of 2 hours of evolution; in the physical examination he presents cold and sweaty skin, blood pressure of 80 mm Hg; electrocardiogram with marked ST segment elevation in leads V1-V6, I and aVL. Which of the following treatments of coronary repercussion is the most appropriate?  The most appropriate treatment for this patient, who presents with intense precordial pain, cold and sweaty skin, hypotension, and an electrocardiogram showing marked ST segment elevation, is immediate transfer to a tertiary center for percutaneous coronary revascularization procedure. This is because the patient is presenting with signs of acute myocardial infarction with ST-elevation (STEMI), which requires rapid restoration of blood flow to the affected coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred reperfusion strategy for STEMI when it can be performed in a timely manner, as it offers better outcomes compared to fibrinolytic therapy. The patient's clinical instability and the presence of residual paresis from a previous stroke suggest that he may not be a good candidate for fibrinolytic therapy, which has a risk of intracranial hemorrhage, especially in patients with a history of stroke. Therefore, immediate transfer to a tertiary center for PCI is the most appropriate treatment to achieve timely reperfusion and minimize myocardial damage.", "options": {"1": "Immediate treatment with fondaparinux and abciximab.", "2": "Immediate systemic fibrinolysis at the regional hospital.", "3": "Hemodynamic stabilization and deferred revascularization procedure.", "4": "Immediate transfer to a tertiary center for percutaneous coronary revascularization procedure.", "5": "Immediate transfer to a tertiary center for treatment with fibrinolysis."}, "correct_option": 4}

Pending definitive histologic and microbiologic results, what antimicrobial would you add to the treatment?  The presence of an infiltrate with halo sign and crescentic meniscus on the chest X-ray/CT scan suggests a fungal infection, likely pulmonary aspergillosis. The peripheral location of the lesion justifies a transthoracic puncture for sampling. In this context, the antifungal of choice to add to the treatment while awaiting definitive results is Voriconazole, as it is the recommended initial therapy for invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients.  Therefore, the correct argument in favor of the correct answer is: The antifungal of choice to add to the treatment while awaiting definitive results is Voriconazole.", "options": {"1": "Piperacillin-tazobactam.", "2": "Voriconazole.", "3": "Caspofungin.", "4": "Fluconazole.", "5": "Ganciclovir."}, "correct_option": 2}

She has a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis and mild cognitive impairment. She suffers a fall when getting up at night to go to the bathroom. X-ray shows a displaced subcapital fracture of the right hip. What is the recommended treatment?  The recommended treatment for a 95-year-old woman with a displaced subcapital fracture of the right hip is hip hemiarthroplasty. This is because hip hemiarthroplasty is a surgical procedure that replaces the broken portion of the hip with an artificial ball and socket joint. It is typically recommended for elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures, as it allows for early mobilization and reduces the risk of complications associated with prolonged immobility. Conservative management with bed-chair life may lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pressure ulcers, and pneumonia, and is therefore not recommended in this case.", "options": {"1": "Hip hemiarthroplasty.", "2": "", "3": "Conservative: bed-chair life.", "4": "Fixation with cannulated screws.", "5": "Trochanteric nail fixation."}, "correct_option": 1}

Histopathologically there is a subepidermal blister with PAS+ deposits in and around the superficial dermal vessels. The most plausible diagnosis is:  The presence of subepidermal blisters, skin fragility, and PAS+ deposits in and around the superficial dermal vessels suggests a diagnosis of pemphigoid. This is because pemphigoid is an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease characterized by autoantibodies against hemidesmosomes or lamina lucida/lamina densa proteins, leading to a separation beneath the epidermal basement membrane. The skin fragility and sun-induced blisters are consistent with this diagnosis. In contrast, familial benign pemphigus typically presents with oral erosions and flaccid blisters, while pemphigus vulgaris shows suprabasal acantholysis and a tombstone appearance on histology.

One fall occurred while he was walking in the garden. His medical history includes hypertension without postural changes in blood pressure, gout, osteoarthritis, and depression. She takes 5 medications regularly. Which of the following is most likely to contribute to falls in this patient?  The patient's falls are likely to be multifactorial, but given the medications he is taking, paroxetine is most likely to contribute to falls. Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat depression, but it can also have side effects that increase the risk of falls, such as orthostatic hypotension, sedation, and impaired balance and coordination. The other medications the patient is taking, such as allopurinol, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril, are less likely to directly contribute to falls. Allopurinol is used to treat gout and is not typically associated with an increased risk of falls. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic used to treat hypertension and can cause electrolyte imbalances, but it is not directly linked to falls. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension and heart failure and is not commonly associated with falls.", "options": {"1": "", "2": "Paroxetine.", "3": "Hydrochlorothiazide.", "4": "Lisinopril.", "5": "Allopurinol."}, "correct_option": 2}

She presents no objectifiable loss of strength, preserves neck mobility although it is painful and contracture of the paravertebral musculature is appreciated. The first attitude will be:  The patient's symptoms suggest a possible cervical radiculopathy, characterized by neck pain radiating to the arm and hand, accompanied by paresthesia. This condition is likely due to compression or irritation of a nerve root in the cervical spine. The absence of objectifiable loss of strength and preserved neck mobility suggest a non-surgical approach as the initial management. Conservative treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, local heat, and relative rest is often effective in relieving pain and reducing inflammation in such cases. Urgent surgical evaluation is not indicated at this stage, as the clinical presentation does not suggest a more severe condition requiring immediate intervention. Therefore, the initial attitude should be conservative treatment.", "options": {"1": "Preferential request for MRI and electromyogram.", "2": "Urgent call to the neurosurgeon for surgical evaluation.", "3": "", "4": "Preferential referral to traumatology outpatients.", "5": "Conservative treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, local heat and relative rest."}, "correct_option": 5}

She consulted for presenting a picture of cervical lymphadenopathy and fever of two weeks of evolution. The puncture of one of the lymph nodes showed isolated acid-fast bacilli and epithelioid granulomas:  The correct diagnosis is an opportunistic infection unmasked within a picture of immune reconstitution. This is supported by the fact that the patient's CD4 count has increased and the viral load has decreased after starting antiretroviral therapy, indicating an improvement in immune function. The presence of isolated acid-fast bacilli and epithelioid granulomas in the lymph node biopsy is suggestive of tuberculosis, which is an opportunistic infection that can be unmasked as the immune system improves.

He had a colonoscopy three years ago in which diverticula were reported along the entire colon, more numerous in the left colon, with no other associated lesions. Which of the following would be the best approach to follow?  The patient's symptoms suggest a possible acute diverticulitis, characterized by abdominal pain in the left iliac fossa, diarrhea, and no evidence of infection or peritoneal irritation. Given the absence of alarming signs and the previous knowledge of diverticulosis, the best approach would be to initiate empirical treatment with antibiotics to cover common bacteria associated with diverticular disease, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli. This treatment aims to reduce inflammation and prevent complications. A colonoscopy could be considered after symptom resolution to reassess the colon and rule out other associated lesions.

After one week of treatment, the patient shows no improvement. What is the next therapeutic measure to be taken?  In the case of a severe flare-up of ulcerative colitis that does not respond to prednisone, the next therapeutic measure to be taken is usually the association of an immunosuppressant such as azathioprine. This is because azathioprine is effective in inducing remission in patients with active disease and has a steroid-sparing effect, allowing for a reduction in the dose of prednisone.

In this case, the patient is presenting with acute dehydration and orthostatic hypotension, which indicates a significant loss of fluid volume. The elevated serum sodium level suggests a hypertonic dehydration, which occurs when water loss exceeds sodium loss. The initial treatment should aim to restore the fluid volume and correct the electrolyte imbalance. Hypertonic saline (3%) is the most appropriate choice because it helps to rapidly correct the fluid deficit and provides sodium to correct the hypertonicity. The use of 5% glucose along with the hypertonic saline helps to provide additional calories and promote rehydration.

He is currently asymptomatic with a CD4 count above 200 cls/microliter. Which vaccines should we recommend?  For an HIV-positive individual with a CD4 count above 200 cells/microliter, it is recommended to administer vaccines that are not live attenuated to avoid the risk of vaccine-induced infections. In this case, the seasonal influenza vaccine, which is an inactivated vaccine, should be recommended due to the increased risk of influenza complications in immunocompromised individuals. Additionally, the pneumococcal vaccine is recommended due to the high risk of pneumococcal infections in HIV-positive individuals. The tetravalent meningitis vaccine should also be considered in certain populations, such as those with potential exposure to meningitis or during outbreaks.

During the previous 4-5 months she noted asthenia, anorexia and unspecified weight loss. Physical examination revealed tension ascites and malleolar edema, with no other relevant signs. An ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen showed the presence of ascites, of homogeneous density, without peritoneal implants or abdominal or pelvic masses. Liver, pancreas, adrenal, spleen and kidneys without significant findings. Paracentesis is performed through a thick needle, obtaining with difficulty a somewhat yellowish, dense and gelatinous fluid. What is the most probable etiology?  The most probable etiology of the patient's symptoms is Chylous ascites due to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the peritoneal cavity, which can lead to ascites. The yellowish, dense and gelatinous fluid obtained during paracentesis is consistent with chyle, which is a milky fluid rich in lipids. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can cause obstruction of the lymphatic vessels, leading to the accumulation of chyle in the peritoneal cavity.

After routine control, a persistent blood pressure of 190 and TAD 80 mmHg was observed. What would be the most reasonable therapeutic modification to achieve blood pressure control?  The most reasonable therapeutic modification to achieve blood pressure control in this 87-year-old man would be to change ibuprofen to paracetamol. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can attenuate the antihypertensive effect of thiazide diuretics, which the patient is already taking. Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a safer alternative for pain management in patients with hypertension because it does not interfere with the blood pressure-lowering effects of antihypertensive medications. Therefore, switching from ibuprofen to paracetamol can help to avoid the potential negative impact on blood pressure control and contribute to achieving the therapeutic goal.", "options": {"1": "", "2": "I would add an alpha-blocker because of the high prevalence of prostatic syndrome in males of this age.", "3": "I would increase the dose of hydrochlorothiazide to 25 mg/day.", "4": "I would change ibuprofen to paracetamol to avoid the possible influence of paracetamol on the effect of hypotensives.", "5": "I would add a calcium channel blocker."}, "correct_option": 4}

Physical examination shows no significant findings except for eczematous lesions in the popliteal and antecubital hollows. Which of the following complementary tests would you NOT perform according to the most probable diagnoses?  In this case, the most probable diagnosis is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), considering the symptoms of heartburn, dysphagia, and eczematous lesions, along with the family history of hiatal hernia and personal history of allergies. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, esophageal pHmetry of 24 hours, and carbon 13 breath test for Helicobacter pylori are useful tests for diagnosing GERD. However, an esophago-gastro-duodenal barium study is not typically performed in the initial evaluation of GERD or EoE in the absence of indications such as dysphagia due to a mechanical obstruction or severe esophageal motility disorders.

Given the patient's symptoms of intense pain in the leg, especially at night, along with the absence of distal pulses and the presence of varicose veins, the first examination to be performed should be focused on assessing arterial flow. This is because the symptoms suggest possible peripheral arterial disease, which is common in patients with hypertension and diabetes. The ankle-brachial index is a non-invasive test that compares the blood pressure in the lower legs to the arms and is the initial diagnostic test for peripheral arterial disease.

She has a magnetic resonance imaging study in which the rotator cuff is undamaged. What is the most likely diagnosis of suspicion?  The most likely diagnosis of suspicion is an axillary nerve injury. This is supported by the clinical findings of dysesthesia in the lateral region of the shoulder and limited abduction to only 15 degrees.

In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, left bundle branch block, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 26%, the implantation of a cardiac resynchronization system is recommended to improve symptoms and survival. This is because these patients often have evidence of electrical dyssynchrony, which can be corrected by a biventricular pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, leading to improved cardiac function and quality of life. Surgical coronary revascularization is not indicated as there is no mention of coronary artery disease.

Which of the following pathologies is she most likely to present?  The patient's symptoms of eye pain, headache, and blurred vision, particularly in low light conditions such as watching television at night, along with a history of wearing high diopter glasses, are suggestive of glaucoma due to primary angular closure. This condition occurs when the drainage angle of the eye is obstructed, leading to increased intraocular pressure, which can cause eye pain, headaches, and blurred vision. The blurred vision is often worse in the evening or in dim light due to the pupil dilating and further obstructing the already narrow angle.

The patient is being treated with a combination of high-dose salmeterol/budesonide (50/500 mg: 2 puffs twice daily), maintenance oral prednisone (10 mg/day) and theophylline. Of the following options, which is the most advisable therapeutic approach?  The most advisable therapeutic approach for this patient is to add omalizumab. This is because the patient has severe persistent asthma, as evidenced by frequent exacerbations, nocturnal symptoms, and the need for high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, and oral prednisone. Omalizumab is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody that is recommended for patients with severe asthma who are not adequately controlled on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. It reduces asthma exacerbations and improves asthma control in patients with a positive skin test for allergens, which this patient has for mites. Adding magnesium sulfate may provide short-term bronchodilation but is not a long-term solution for severe asthma. Increasing the dose of prednisone may lead to more side effects without necessarily improving asthma control. Nebulized treatment at home can be helpful for acute exacerbations but is not a substitute for long-term control.

He only has dyspnea when climbing stairs and some nights he sleeps irregularly due to coughing. Which of the following therapeutic options should be considered as the treatment of choice?  The treatment of choice should be to switch to combined therapy with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-adrenergics. This is because the patient has been stable with no exacerbations and only occasional dyspnea and coughing, indicating that his current regimen may not be fully controlling his symptoms. Adding a long-acting beta2-adrenergic to the existing inhaled corticosteroid can improve symptom control and reduce the need for rescue medication, which the patient is using once a day.

A complete blood test showed proteinuria of 8 g/day without microhematuria, hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia with normal renal function. He was empirically administered corticosteroids. After one month, the clinical picture has completely disappeared. What is your diagnostic hypothesis?  The clinical picture of edema, proteinuria of 8 g/day without microhematuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia, along with a complete response to corticosteroids, is indicative of nephropathy with minimal changes. This condition, also known as minimal change disease, is characterized by the absence of significant glomerular abnormalities on microscopy and is responsive to corticosteroid therapy. The presence of normal renal function and the absence of other findings such as amyloid deposits or IgA deposits, which are seen in amyloidosis and IgA nephropathy respectively, support the diagnosis of nephropathy with minimal changes.

Which of the following options would you choose?  The correct approach for a 45-year-old woman with a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion on cervicovaginal cytology is to perform a colposcopy with possible biopsy. This is because high-grade lesions have a higher risk of progressing to invasive cancer, and colposcopy allows for direct visualization of the cervical epithelium and targeted biopsy to determine the extent of the lesion and guide further management. Repeating cytology in 1 month would not be appropriate as it delays definitive diagnosis and management.

He is suffering from psychotic depression. He is physically able to eat. Psychotropic medication is started and discontinued due to adverse events. If his nutritional status improves it is possible to resume his medications. He refuses intravenous fluids and then accepts them but the IV is started a few hours later. An alternative is to perform a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and discharge him to his residence. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action for this patient?  In this case, the most appropriate course of action would be to assess whether the residence will take the patient if PEG is not performed. This is because the patient has the capacity to eat but refuses to do so, leading to significant weight loss and malnutrition. The patient's family member has recently passed away, which has contributed to his depression and refusal to eat. It is important to explore all possible options to ensure the patient receives proper nutrition and care.

There is no relevant data in the EC except platelets 75000/mm3 (htco 36%, leukocytes 4100 79% neutrophils). What is the most likely diagnosis?  The patient's symptoms, including high fever, intense arthromyalgia, headache, and a generalized pruritic maculo-papular rash that developed into petechiae, along with thrombocytopenia (platelets 75000/mm3), are consistent with the diagnosis of Dengue fever. Dengue fever is a viral illness transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, which is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, including Cuba. The symptoms typically start with a high fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, and rash, which can progress to petechiae. Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in Dengue fever.

A thickness of the endometrium greater than 5 mm is suspicious of endometrial pathology, including hyperplasia or cancer. In this case, with a 7 mm endometrium and considering the patient's symptoms, an endometrial biopsy is necessary to rule out any pathology. Tranexamic acid and ambulatory follow-up may be considered if the endometrium is not thickened and there are no other concerning symptoms.

The treatment of choice for a 60-year-old diabetic patient with stable angina secondary to ischemic heart disease due to subtotal obstruction in the middle third of the anterior descending coronary artery would be surgical revascularization of the ischemic myocardium by means of a left mammary artery bypass distal to the lesion in the diseased coronary artery. This approach is chosen because it provides a more permanent solution to restore blood flow to the ischemic myocardium, which is crucial in patients with significant coronary artery disease and stable angina. Medical management with vasodilators and beta-blockers can help alleviate symptoms but does not address the underlying issue of inadequate blood supply. Expectorant with rigorous rest is not a suitable treatment option as it does not address the cause of angina.

Indicate which diagnostic tests would be necessary to confirm the most likely diagnosis:  The combination of a pathological fracture, anemia (low hemoglobin), hyperproteinemia (high total proteins), hypoalbuminemia (low serum albumin), and renal impairment (high serum creatinine and beta 2 microglobulin) suggests the possibility of multiple myeloma. This is a plasma cell neoplasm that can cause lytic bone lesions, leading to pathological fractures. It also produces excessive immunoglobulins, leading to hyperproteinemia, and can cause renal impairment. To confirm the diagnosis, serum and urine electrophoresis are necessary to detect the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M protein), and renal function tests are needed to assess the extent of kidney involvement.

Which of the following tests would be most useful in diagnosing the cause of the pleural effusion?  The most useful test for diagnosing the cause of the pleural effusion in this patient would be the measurement of adenosine deaminase (ADA) in pleural fluid. ADA is an enzyme involved in purine metabolism and is commonly used as a diagnostic marker for tuberculous pleuritis.

Of the following, indicate the correct option:  Given the patient's presentation of cyanotic mottled lesions on the toes, history of smoking, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, and imaging findings of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm with mural thrombus, the most appropriate intervention is open surgical repair. This is because the aneurysm is at risk of rupture, which is a life-threatening complication. Open surgical repair involves replacing the aneurysmal segment with a tubular prosthesis and reimplantation of the supra-aortic trunks. This approach is necessary to prevent rupture and to restore proper blood flow. Statin therapy is not sufficient to stabilize the thrombus in this case, and urgent diagnostic aortography is not necessary as the diagnosis has already been made with CT angiography.

What attitude do you think is correct?  Given the patient's progressive lymphocytosis with a predominance of mature lymphocytes expressing CD5/CD19/CD23 antigens, along with a high leukocyte count and normal hemoglobin and platelet levels, the most appropriate step is to perform a bone aspirate/biopsy. This procedure is crucial for confirming the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is suggested by the peripheral blood findings.

Indicate the treatment you would use:  The patient presents with an erythematous-orange plaque on the right cheek that has ulcerated and is covered with a scab. This presentation, along with the history of an insect bite, is suggestive of a cutaneous leishmaniasis. The fact that the patient is from Valencia, a region where leishmaniasis is endemic, further supports this diagnosis. The treatment of choice for cutaneous leishmaniasis is intralesional meglumine antimoniate. This medication is directly injected into the lesion and is effective in treating the infection.

X-ray shows a displaced subcapital fracture of the right hip. What is the recommended treatment?  The recommended treatment for a displaced subcapital fracture of the right hip in a 95-year-old woman with her described medical history and level of independence is hip hemiarthroplasty. This surgical option is typically chosen for older patients with a high risk of complications from prolonged immobilization and for those who were independent prior to the fracture.

What is the most correct approach?  Given the patient's symptoms of asthenia and dyspnea on exertion, along with a history of slight epigastralgia and occasional heartburn, and the findings of a small sliding hiatal hernia on endoscopy, the most correct approach would be to administer oral iron and monitor the evolution of anemia. The laboratory tests indicate iron deficiency anemia with low hemoglobin, low mean corpuscular volume, low sideremia, and low ferritin levels.

His severe spinal deformity makes it difficult to perform percutaneous renal biopsy. What is the correct initial approach?  The initial approach should be a subcutaneous fat biopsy. This is because the patient's symptoms of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, along with the absence of hematuria, suggest a glomerular disease. However, due to the severe spinal deformity, a percutaneous renal biopsy may not be feasible.

We should suspect that he presents:  The clinical presentation of a 12-year-old boy with mechanical pain in the right thigh and knee, a 1 cm discrepancy in the length of the lower extremities, and an attitude of the right lower extremity in external rotation with loss of internal rotation, is highly suggestive of a hip pathology. The most common cause of these symptoms in an obese adolescent is epiphysiolysis capitis femoris, also known as slipped capital femoral epiphysis. This condition occurs when the growth plate in the femur becomes weakened and the femoral head slips out of place.

Which of the following measures would NOT be included in the INITIAL management?  In the initial management of septic shock, measures aimed at restoring tissue perfusion and controlling infection are prioritized. Fluid administration is crucial to correct hypotension and improve organ perfusion. Serum lactate measurement helps assess the severity of shock and monitor response to treatment.

Which of the following is a poor prognostic factor after surgical resection and should be taken into account when planning chemotherapy treatment?  The size of the primary lesion and histological differentiation are important factors to consider when planning chemotherapy treatment for adenocarcinoma of the sigma. Tumors with larger size and poorer histological differentiation tend to have a worse prognosis and may require more aggressive treatment. Anemia at diagnosis is also a poor prognostic factor, as it can indicate chronic bleeding from the tumor and therefore a more advanced stage of disease. The existence of a family history of colorectal cancer is not directly related to prognosis after surgical resection, but it may influence the decision to perform genetic testing or recommend increased surveillance in family members.

What is the first therapeutic measure you would prescribe for this patient immediately?  The first therapeutic measure for this patient with cirrhosis and ascites presenting with symptoms suggestive of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is to initiate empirical antibiotic treatment with a third generation cephalosporin, such as cefotaxime.

However, after starting treatment with acenocoumarol, she develops a picture of skin necrosis affecting the abdominal region and extremities. Which of the following alterations would justify this picture?  Warfarin and acenocoumarol act by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, and X). This effect is mediated by the inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) by warfarin or acenocoumarol. The inhibition of this enzyme leads to a decrease in the levels of reduced vitamin K (active form), which is necessary for the synthesis of these coagulation factors. This mechanism of action is the basis of the anticoagulant effect of these drugs. However, this inhibition also affects the synthesis of other vitamin K-dependent proteins, such as proteins C and S, which are natural anticoagulants. The inhibition of protein C, which has a shorter half-life compared to procoagulant factors, leads to a temporary hypercoagulable state. This imbalance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors can result in microvascular thrombosis, manifesting as skin necrosis, particularly in areas with abundant subcutaneous fat like the breasts, thighs, and buttocks. This complication is more likely to occur in patients with an underlying genetic deficiency of protein C, as they are more susceptible to the imbalance", "options": {"1": "Hyperhomocysteinemia.", "2": "Protein C deficiency.", "3": "", "4": "Factor V Leiden.", "5": "Antithrombin deficiency."}, "correct_option": 2}

Which clinical elements would NOT be important in determining that she is at high clinical risk for pulmonary thromboembolism?  In determining the high clinical risk for pulmonary thromboembolism in this 59-year-old woman, her history of osteoporosis would not be considered an important clinical element. This is because osteoporosis itself does not directly increase the risk of developing a pulmonary embolism. However, other factors such as a history of breast cancer, prolonged immobility (more than 3 days), and the presence of unilateral calf edema and pain on palpation are significant clinical elements that increase the suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism.

Digoxin does not provide benefit to the patient according to the currently available evidence in the management of chronic heart failure. While digoxin can be useful in reducing symptoms and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, it does not improve survival or other clinical outcomes. In this case, since the patient has severe non-revascularizable systolic dysfunction and is already on optimal medical therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, antialdosterone, and beta-blockers, the addition of digoxin would not be expected to provide further benefit and may increase the risk of adverse effects due to its narrow therapeutic index.", "options": {"1": "Antialdosterone.", "2": "", "3": "Beta-blockers.", "4": "Ivabradine.", "5": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors."}, "correct_option": 4}

Becker muscular dystrophy is caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene located on the X chromosome. Since the man has a partial deletion in this gene, he has Becker muscular dystrophy. This means that he has one X chromosome with the mutation and one Y chromosome. Since his wife does not have the mutation, she will contribute one X chromosome without the mutation to their offspring. Therefore, their daughters will receive one X chromosome with the mutation from their father and one X chromosome without the mutation from their mother, making them carriers of the disease but not affected.

The clinical picture of recurrent infections, thrombocytopenic purpura, atopic dermatitis, and a family history of males dying in childhood from infections, along with the immunological findings of decreased T lymphocytes and elevated IgA and IgE levels, is consistent with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. This X-linked syndrome is characterized by a triad of eczema, thrombocytopenia, and repeated infections due to immunodeficiency.

In this case, the most correct option would be Chemotherapy plus preoperative radiotherapy. This is because squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is highly sensitive to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Preoperative chemoradiation can significantly reduce the size of the tumor, making it more resectable and potentially increasing the chances of achieving clear surgical margins.

However, after starting treatment with acenocoumarol, she develops a picture of skin necrosis affecting the abdominal region and extremities. Which of the following alterations would justify this picture?  Warfarin and acenocoumarol act by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, and X). This effect is mediated by the inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) by warfarin or acenocoumarol. The inhibition of this enzyme leads to a decrease in the levels of reduced vitamin K (active form), which is necessary for the synthesis of these coagulation factors. This mechanism of action is the basis of the anticoagulant effect of these drugs. However, this inhibition also affects the synthesis of other vitamin K-dependent proteins, such as proteins C and S, which are natural anticoagulants. The inhibition of protein C, which has a shorter half-life compared to procoagulant factors, leads to a temporary hypercoagulable state. This imbalance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors can result in microvascular thrombosis, manifesting as skin necrosis, particularly in areas with abundant subcutaneous fat like the breasts, thighs, and buttocks. This complication is more likely to occur in patients with an underlying genetic deficiency of protein C, as they are more susceptible to the imbalance", "options": {"1": "Antithrombin deficiency.", "2": "", "3": "Protein C deficiency.", "4": "Hyperhomocysteinemia.", "5": "Factor V Leiden."}, "correct_option": 3}

The treatment of choice for Cushing's disease, especially when associated with a pituitary macroadenoma, is selective surgical resection of the adenoma. This approach directly addresses the underlying cause of excess cortisol production by removing the adenoma. Medical treatment may be considered as an adjunct or when surgery is not successful or contraindicated.

As history he refers that one month ago he presented an episode of otalgia, fever accompanied by irritability and that he was treated with amoxicillin 40 mg/kg/day. What is the most probable diagnosis?  The most probable diagnosis is Chronic cholesteatomatous otitis media. This condition is characterized by persistent perforation of the tympanic membrane and presence of cholesteatoma, a type of granulation tissue, in the middle ear or mastoid. The pinkish/amber color of the tympanic membrane is indicative of the presence of granulation tissue. The patient's history of recurrent episodes of otalgia, fever, and irritability, along with the current findings, suggests a chronic process rather than an acute or recurrent acute otitis media.

His severe spinal deformity makes it difficult to perform percutaneous renal biopsy. What is the correct initial approach?  The initial approach should be a subcutaneous fat biopsy. This is because the patient's symptoms of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, along with the absence of hematuria, suggest a glomerular disease. However, due to the severe spinal deformity, a percutaneous renal biopsy may not be feasible. A subcutaneous fat biopsy can be performed to look for amyloid deposits, which can help diagnose amyloidosis, a common complication of ankylosing spondylitis that can cause glomerular disease.

She presents no objectifiable loss of strength, preserves neck mobility although it is painful and contracture of the paravertebral musculature is appreciated. The first attitude will be:  The patient's symptoms suggest a possible cervical radiculopathy, characterized by neck pain radiating to the arm and hand, accompanied by paresthesia. This condition is likely due to compression or irritation of a nerve root in the cervical spine. The absence of objectifiable loss of strength and preserved neck mobility suggest a non-surgical approach as the initial management. Conservative treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, local heat, and relative rest is often effective in relieving pain and reducing inflammation in such cases. Urgent surgical evaluation is not indicated at this stage, as the clinical presentation does not suggest a more severe condition requiring immediate intervention.

This approach aims to optimize the patient's overall cardiovascular health and reduce the workload on the heart. Diuretics may be used judiciously to manage fluid overload and symptoms of congestion, but starting at high doses can lead to electrolyte imbalances and renal dysfunction, so they should be titrated carefully. Nitrate therapy, if necessary, should be initiated cautiously at low doses due to the potential for hypotension and adverse effects on cardiac function.

The syndromic diagnosis of acute monoarthritis is made. What is the most likely etiologic diagnosis?  The most likely etiologic diagnosis is bacterial infectious arthritis. This is because the patient presents with acute onset of joint pain, swelling, and functional impotence, along with systemic signs of infection such as fever, leukocytosis, and elevated C-reactive protein.

Indicate which would be the best recommendation to establish the etiological diagnosis of the patient's condition:  The presence of conjunctival jaundice, pruritus, asthenia, dry mouth, and absence of lacrimation, along with elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels, suggests a cholestatic liver disease. The non-painful hepatomegaly and the absence of a history of alcohol consumption or hepatotoxic drug use make alcoholic liver disease and drug-induced liver injury unlikely. The combination of these clinical findings and laboratory results is highly suggestive of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a chronic autoimmune cholestatic liver disease that primarily affects women.

The correct attitude is to instigate treatment with paracetamol, explain to the patient that the evolution of the condition is very variable, and indicate that the surgical indication depends on functionality and pain control. This approach is justified by the fact that the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with coxarthrosis (osteoarthritis of the hip), which is a degenerative condition characterized by progressive joint space narrowing, sclerosis, and osteophyte formation. Paracetamol is often the first-line pharmacological treatment for pain management in osteoarthritis.

In cases of severe gonarthrosis with significant functional impotence, limited mobility, and continuous pain that is unresponsive to conservative treatments such as antirheumatic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic medication, the indicated treatment is a total knee replacement, also known as arthroplasty of the knee. This surgical procedure aims to alleviate pain, improve function, and restore mobility by replacing the damaged joint surfaces with artificial components. Arthroscopic lavage and synovectomy are less invasive procedures that may be considered for milder cases or as adjunctive treatments, but they are not the primary indication in this scenario. Rehabilitation is an important component of the postoperative recovery process but is not sufficient as a standalone treatment in this case.

Of the following options, which is the most advisable therapeutic approach?  The most advisable therapeutic approach for this patient is to add omalizumab. This is because the patient has severe persistent asthma, as evidenced by frequent exacerbations, nocturnal symptoms, and the need for high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, and oral prednisone. Omalizumab is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody that is recommended for patients with severe asthma who are not adequately controlled on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. It reduces asthma exacerbations and improves asthma control in patients with a positive skin test for allergens, which this patient has for mites. Adding magnesium sulfate may provide short-term bronchodilation but is not a long-term solution for severe asthma. Increasing the dose of prednisone may lead to more side effects without necessarily improving asthma control. Nebulized treatment at home can be helpful for acute exacerbations but is not a substitute for long-term control.

Her younger brother (index case) aged 26 years is affected by ataxia and genetically diagnosed as a heterozygous carrier of an expansive mutation of 70 CAG repeats in the SCA3 gene (chromosome 14). The patient is referred to the genetic counseling office where a possible chorionic villus biopsy to study the fetal genotype is evaluated. Is this invasive procedure indicated as a pre-natal diagnosis (PND) in this case?  The invasive procedure of chorionic villus biopsy for pre-natal diagnosis (PND) is indicated after studying the Consultant's genotype and only if it is heterozygous. This is because SCA3 ataxia is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that if the Consultant is a carrier (heterozygous), there is a 50% chance of transmitting the mutation to the fetus. In such cases, PND can provide valuable information to the parents regarding the fetal genotype and allow them to make informed decisions about the pregnancy. However, if the Consultant is not a carrier (homozygous normal), the risk of disease transmission to the fetus is negligible, and therefore, PND would not be indicated.", "options": {"1": "It is indicated after studying the Consultant's genotype and only if it is heterozygous.", "2": "This is not indicated, since SCA3 ataxia is full penetrance and the Consultant is asymptomatic and therefore has not inherited the mutation.", "3": "This is indicated regardless of the Consultant's genotype, since SCA3 ataxia is maternally inherited (transmitted by women).", "4": "It may be indicated in the next pregnancy, after studying the genotype of the first child and detecting the mutation in it.", "5": "SCA3 ataxia is recessively inherited, so there is no appreciable risk of disease transmission and PND is not indicated."}, "correct_option": 1}
{"question": "18-month-old boy, with complete vaccination schedule to date, who consults the Emergency Department for swelling of the right knee after playing in the park, without obvious trauma.

The ultrasound examination is compatible with hemarthrosis and in the analysis performed only an APTT lengthening of 52â³ (normal 25-35â³) stands out. What is the most likely diagnostic hypothesis?  The most likely diagnostic hypothesis in this case is Hemophilia A. This is supported by the presence of hemarthrosis (swelling of the joint due to bleeding) in a young male with a normal vaccination schedule and no history of trauma. The prolonged APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) is indicative of a deficiency in clotting factors, which is characteristic of hemophilia A. Additionally, the family history of a similar problem in an uncle suggests a genetic component, which is consistent with the X-linked inheritance pattern of hemophilia A.

Mark the CORRECT statement:   The patient's symptoms and auscultatory findings are indicative of heart failure. The presence of bilateral crackles, holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla, and gallop rhythm (third and fourth sounds) are classic signs of left-sided heart failure. The third heart sound occurs during the rapid filling phase of ventricular diastole and is associated with volume overload in the ventricle.

Bone marrow examination was performed and she was diagnosed with acute leukemia with t(15;17) in 60% of the cells. Which of the following answers is correct?  The diagnosis of acute leukemia with t(15;17) translocation in 60% of cells is indicative of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). APL is characterized by the presence of the PML-RARÎ± fusion gene, which results from the t(15;17) translocation. This subtype of AML is associated with a high risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Therefore, the most appropriate treatment would be the combination of arsenic trioxide, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and supportive therapy.

{"question": "A 32-year-old asymptomatic woman goes for a gynecological health check-up because she wishes to become pregnant. During this check-up, a 4cm uterine myoma is detected, partly intramural and partly subserosal, located on the anterior aspect of the uterus and which does not deform the endometrial cavity. What approach would you recommend?  The recommended approach for a 32-year-old asymptomatic woman with a 4cm uterine myoma who wishes to become pregnant is attempting pregnancy without any previous treatment. This is because uterine myomas are common and often do not interfere with pregnancy. The myoma in this case does not deform the endometrial cavity, which is a critical factor in determining the need for intervention. Treatment for myomas, such as myomectomy or embolization, is typically reserved for cases where the myoma causes symptoms or significantly affects the chances of conception or pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, in this asymptomatic case with no evidence of compromised fertility or pregnancy-related complications, the best recommendation is to attempt pregnancy without intervention.", "options": {"1": "Treatment with Gn-Rh analogues for three months before attempting pregnancy.", "2": "Myoma embolization by arterial catheterization.", "3": "Laparotomic myomectomy.", "4": "Attempting pregnancy without any previous treatment.", "5": "Laparoscopic myomectomy."}, "correct_option": 4}

The tumor had been detected by chance in an abdominal CT scan requested to complete the study of a simple hepatic cyst. On questioning the patient, the history of irregular menstruation, amenorrhea for the last 6 months, and repeated renal colic since she was 20 years old, for which she has required lithotripsy on several occasions, stand out. She also has a family history of renoureteral colic. What is her suspected diagnosis?  The patient's history of irregular menstruation, amenorrhea, and repeated renal colic, along with a family history of renoureteral colic, suggests a diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) or Wermer's syndrome. MEN 1 is characterized by the presence of tumors in multiple endocrine organs, including the pancreas, parathyroid glands, and pituitary gland.

Indicate the treatment you will propose to achieve fertility:  The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is characterized by low levels of FSH and LH and decreased testosterone. This condition can lead to impaired development of secondary sexual characteristics and infertility. Since the patient has a normal prolactin level, hyperprolactinemia is unlikely to be the cause. The presence of hyposmia suggests an underlying condition affecting the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Therefore, the appropriate treatment to induce gonadal development and achieve fertility would be the administration of GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone), either through an infusion pump or monthly intramuscular injections. This will stimulate the production of FSH and LH from the pituitary gland, leading to increased testosterone levels and spermatogenesis.", "options": {"1": "Gn_RH infusion pump.", "2": "Treatment with bromocriptine.", "3": "Monthly intramuscular administration of triptorelin.", "4": "", "5": "Intramuscular administration of FSH and LH once a week."}, "correct_option": 1}

Bronchoscopy shows paralysis of the left vocal cord, without endoscopic image suggestive of neoplasia. What is the most likely diagnosis?  The most likely diagnosis is pulmonary neoplasia. This is supported by the patient's symptoms of dysphonia, asthenia, and weight loss, which can be associated with a mass in the chest. The increased density in the left upper lobe and occupation of the aortopulmonary window on the chest X-ray further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the paralysis of the left vocal cord without an endoscopic image suggestive of neoplasia indicates that the neoplastic process may be extrinsic to the vocal cord itself, possibly in the lung or other adjacent structures, causing compression or infiltration of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

Which therapeutic option is the most appropriate for this patient?  For a 34-year-old woman with a high grade intraepithelial lesion (U-SIL) on cytology and a focus of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of 2 mm in length on biopsy, the most appropriate therapeutic option is a conization. This procedure involves the removal of a cone-shaped section of abnormal cervical tissue, which is sufficient for early-stage invasive cancer. It preserves fertility and is less invasive than a total hysterectomy.

Bone marrow examination was performed and she was diagnosed with acute leukemia with t(15;17) in 60% of the cells. Which of the following answers is correct?  The diagnosis of acute leukemia with t(15;17) translocation in 60% of cells is indicative of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). APL is characterized by the presence of the PML-RARÎ± fusion gene, which results from the t(15;17) translocation. This subtype of AML is associated with a high risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Therefore, the most appropriate treatment would be the combination of arsenic trioxide, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and supportive therapy. Arsenic trioxide and ATRA are specifically effective in inducing differentiation of the promyelocytes in APL, while supportive therapy is necessary to manage the complications associated with DIC and leukemia treatment.

Physical examination shows no significant findings except for eczematous lesions in the popliteal and antecubital hollows. Which of the following complementary tests would you NOT perform according to the most probable diagnoses?  In this case, the most probable diagnosis is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), considering the symptoms of heartburn, dysphagia, and eczematous lesions, along with the family history of hiatal hernia and personal history of allergies. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, esophageal pHmetry of 24 hours, and carbon 13 breath test for Helicobacter pylori are useful tests for diagnosing GERD. However, an esophago-gastro-duodenal barium study is not typically performed in the initial evaluation of GERD or EoE in the absence of indications such as dysphagia due to a mechanical obstruction or severe esophageal motility disorders.

Which of the following drugs does NOT provide benefit to the patient according to the currently available evidence?  Digoxin does not provide benefit to the patient according to the currently available evidence in the management of chronic heart failure. While digoxin can be useful in reducing symptoms and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, it does not improve survival or other clinical outcomes. In this case, since the patient has severe non-revascularizable systolic dysfunction and is already on optimal medical therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, antialdosterone, and beta-blockers, the addition of digoxin would not be expected to provide further benefit and may increase the risk of adverse effects due to its narrow therapeutic index.", "options": {"1": "", "2": "Antialdosterone.", "3": "Ivabradine.", "4": "Beta-blockers.", "5": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors."}, "correct_option": 3}

From the data described, it is an alteration that affects, among other elements, the motor fascicles: cortico-spinal and cortico-nuclear, but at what level of the neuroaxis would the lesion be located?  The lesion would be located in the internal capsule, posterior arm on the right side. This is because the internal capsule contains both cortico-spinal and cortico-nuclear tracts, which are responsible for motor function and innervation of the facial muscles.

In this case, we need to identify which pathology does NOT correspond to these symptoms. After analyzing the options, it becomes clear that while adenoviral conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and chlamydia conjunctivitis can present with these symptoms, Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome is less likely to do so. Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome typically presents with granulomatous conjunctivitis and lymphadenopathy, which are not directly related to the symptoms described.

What is the most likely diagnosis?  Early adrenarche is the most likely diagnosis because it is characterized by the early appearance of pubic or axillary hair without an increase in testicular volume or penile size. This condition is caused by an early rise in adrenal androgens, which leads to the development of secondary sexual characteristics without true central precocious puberty.

Analysis: CRP 6 mg/dl (VN <1); hemoglobin 10.5 g/dl; ESR 92 mm. Chest X-ray normal. Considering the most likely diagnosis, check the correct option regarding treatment:  The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is an inflammatory vasculopathy that primarily affects large and medium-sized arteries, and is characterized by headache, jaw claudication, visual disturbances, and elevated inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR. The absence of pulse in the left temporal artery further supports this diagnosis. Treatment for GCA typically involves high-dose glucocorticoids to reduce inflammation and prevent further complications. However, in patients who have ischemic symptoms or contraindications to glucocorticoids, alternative treatments such as tocilizumab may be considered.

The patient is referred to the genetic counseling office where a possible chorionic villus biopsy to study the fetal genotype is evaluated. Is this invasive procedure indicated as a pre-natal diagnosis (PND) in this case? To determine whether to perform a chorionic villus biopsy for prenatal diagnosis, it is necessary to first establish whether the Consultant (mother) carries the SCA3 mutation. Since autosomal dominant disorders like SCA3 can be inherited from just one affected parent, knowing the Consultant's genotype is crucial. If she is a heterozygous carrier, there is a significant risk of passing the mutation to the fetus, and thus the invasive procedure would be indicated. If she is not a carrier, then there is no risk of passing on the mutation, and the procedure would not be necessary. Therefore, the indication for prenatal diagnosis depends on confirming the Consultant's genotype.\n", "options": {"1": "This is not indicated, since SCA3 ataxia is full penetrance and the Consultant is asymptomatic and therefore has not inherited the mutation.", "2": "SCA3 ataxia is recessively inherited, so there is no appreciable risk of disease transmission and PND is not indicated.", "3": "It is indicated after studying the Consultant's genotype and only if it is heterozygous.", "4": "This is indicated regardless of the Consultant's genotype, since SCA3 ataxia is maternally inherited (transmitted by women).", "5": "It may be indicated in the next pregnancy, after studying the genotype of the first child and detecting the mutation in it."}, "correct_option": 3}

Laboratory data: hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL ferritin 450 ng/mL erythrocyte sedimentation rate 115 mm/h. What is the most appropriate immediate action in this patient? The clinical presentation of acute vision loss, accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, pain in large muscles (shoulders, neck, hips), and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, strongly suggests giant cell arteritis (GCA). Immediate high-dose corticosteroid treatment (prednisone 60 mg per day) is necessary to prevent further vision loss and complications, and aspirin is recommended to reduce the risk of ischemic events.

Juan keeps Soï¬a under observation while waiting for her parents to come to the service, periodically taking a look at how the patient is doing. After the initial scare, the patient seems to be increasingly animated and is very friendly. On one occasion, Juan finds her actively chatting on her cell phone. Juan tells her that it would be better for her to put the cell phone down and rest and to reassure her, he tells her that he also uses social networks a lot since college. Soï¬a apologizes for not knowing that she should have her cell phone turned off, and after turning it off, asks if she can make a friend request on Facebook. What do you think is Juan's best response? Maintaining professional boundaries between patients and physicians is crucial to ensure unbiased medical care, and preventing dual relationships that could interfere with the treatment and professional responsibilities.

Cervical palpation is negative for lymphadenopathy. What is your presumptive diagnosis and course of action? Given the patient's significant risk factors (smoking and heavy alcohol consumption), the described symptoms (odynodysphagia and left otalgia), the physical examination findings (decreased propulsive capacity of the tongue and induration of the base of the left tongue), and the exclusion of a dental cause, the clinical picture raises a high suspicion for a malignant process of the oropharynx. A normal head and neck CAT scan without contrast in the context of these findings does not rule out malignancy, especially if the scan was without contrast.

Liver, pancreas, adrenal, spleen and kidneys without significant findings. Paracentesis is performed through a thick needle, obtaining with difficulty a somewhat yellowish, dense and gelatinous fluid. What is the most probable etiology? Peritoneal metastasis of adenocarcinoma is the most likely etiology given the patient's age, the progressive increase in abdominal perimeter, the noted constitutional symptoms (asthenia, anorexia, and weight loss), and the physical examination findings of tension ascites and malleolar edema. The paracentesis yielded a yellowish, dense, and gelatinous fluid, which is characteristic of the mucinous ascites often associated with peritoneal metastasis from adenocarcinoma.

He was infused with 20 ml/kg of crystalloids. During his transfer to the hospital his vital signs improve transiently and then deteriorate on arrival at the hospital. Point out the correct answer: The patient displays signs and symptoms consistent with hypovolemic shock, likely due to significant blood loss from the traffic accident. The initial infusion of 20 ml/kg of crystalloids provided only a transient improvement in his vital signs, indicating that crystalloids alone are insufficient to stabilize him.

Which of the following actions is associated with a greater reduction in the risk of stroke? Smoking cessation is associated with the greatest reduction in the risk of stroke. Smoking is a major modifiable risk factor for stroke because it leads to the development of atherosclerotic plaques, increases blood pressure, and promotes a hypercoagulable state. Quitting smoking reduces the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular events significantly more than other measures mentioned in this context.

There is macroscopic involvement of the sentinel lymph node, although there is no involvement of the rest of the isolated axillary nodes (pN1). What adjuvant systemic treatment do you consider most appropriate for this patient? The patient has a poorly differentiated (grade 3) infiltrating ductal carcinoma, size 2.2 cm (pT2), with macroscopic involvement of the sentinel lymph node (pN1). The tumor is estrogen and progesterone receptor positive with a Ki67 of 25%, which indicates a moderately high proliferative index, and HER2 negative. The combination of these factors (ER/PR positive, HER2 negative, grade 3, and nodal involvement) places her at intermediate to high risk for recurrence. Therefore, it is necessary to provide multimodal adjuvant treatment to reduce the risk of recurrence. Adjuvant chemotherapy (preferably with anthracyclines and taxanes) addresses her higher risk due to tumor grade and nodal involvement, while hormone therapy targets the hormone receptor-positive status of the tumor.", "options": {"1": "Adjuvant chemotherapy, preferably with anthracyclines and taxanes, followed by hormone therapy.", "2": "Adjuvant chemotherapy in association with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, followed by hormone therapy.", "3": "Adjuvant chemotherapy, preferably with anthracyclines and taxanes.", "4": "", "5": "Adjuvant hormone therapy including aromatase inhibitors."}, "correct_option": 1}

The clinical picture presented by the patientâlumbosacral pain with an inflammatory rhythm, bilateral thalalgia, morning stiffness, and accompanying diarrhea with significant weight lossâis highly suggestive of spondyloarthritis. Spondyloarthritis is commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease, making it essential to rule out such a condition.

A week ago the primary care physician prescribed cefuroxime, a drug he is currently taking. Two blood cultures were taken and urine was sent for sediment examination and microbiological culture. The sediment was pathological, with intense pyuria, but negative nitrites. After 24 hours, the microbiology laboratory reported that both the urine and the blood cultures were positive, and the results showed gram-positive cocci grouped in chains, pending identification and antibiogram. Pending the definitive result, what would you recommend? Given the presentation of gram-positive cocci in chains in both urine and blood cultures, coupled with the patient's history of repeated urinary tract infections, Enterococcus spp. is a likely causative pathogen. Therefore, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment that covers Enterococcus spp. would be appropriate, especially since the patient is hemodynamically unstable, indicating severe infection or sepsis.

Of the following statements, which would be the most correct diagnostic and therapeutic approach? The clinical picture described, including pronounced fever, pancytopenia, icteric hepatitis, coagulopathy, very elevated CRP and ferritin levels, along with altered mental status and respiratory failure, is suggestive of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome that can be secondary to infections such as EBV.

In the clinical history the patient refers that he/she has been obese since the age of 17 (currently 36 years old), having been on multiple diets with weight loss ranging from 5 to 10 kg but has subsequently regained weight. The patient is currently on a 1500 Kcal diet (self-administered and not restricted in fat) with a good follow-up of this diet, performing one hour of aerobic exercise 4 days a week. She has lost 3 kg but needs an additional loss of 7 kg more. Given the possibility of adding a drug against obesity, which one would you use to reduce fat absorption? Orlistat works by inhibiting pancreatic lipases, enzymes that break down triglycerides in the intestine. When the activity of these enzymes is blocked, triglycerides from the diet are not hydrolyzed into absorbable free fatty acids and instead are excreted unchanged. This reduces fat absorption and therefore aids in weight loss.", "options": {"1": "Topiramate.", "2": "Metformin.", "3": "Sibutramine.", "4": "Liraglutide.", "5": "Orlistat."}, "correct_option": 5}

One hour after arrival at the emergency room, BP 70/55 mm Hg persists. What would be the most appropriate initial treatment? In this case, the patient presents with hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea on exertion, and CT evidence of pulmonary embolism with a repletion defect in both main pulmonary arteries, indicating a massive pulmonary embolism (PE). The presence of hypotension (BP 75/50 mm Hg) and elevated troponin (1.2 ng/ml) suggest a high-risk PE with hemodynamic instability.

The patient maintains good visual acuity. Where would you most likely locate the lesion? The clinical presentation of palpebral ptosis, anisocoria with the affected eye demonstrating a smaller pupil (miosis), and preserved visual acuity suggests Horner's syndrome. Horner's syndrome results from a disruption of the sympathetic pathways, which can occur at various points from the hypothalamus to the eye. Given the acute onset of symptoms and their nature, the lesion is most likely located in the superior cervical ganglion, which is part of the sympathetic pathway involved in controlling pupil size and eyelid elevation.

An endoscopy was performed in which clots were found in the stomach and a 2 cm ulcer in the gastric antrum with fibrin background and a small grayish-white protrusion of 3 mm in the center of the ulcer (visible platelet thrombus vessel). What do you think is the most correct approach? Endoscopic treatment by injection of adrenaline into the ulcer and placement of clips is appropriate because it effectively provides hemostasis. The patientâs presentation with melena, significant anemia (Hb 8.1 g/dL), hypotension, and tachycardia indicates an ongoing significant bleed which requires active intervention.

Which of the following features associated with headache seems most likely in this patient? In patients with intracranial masses, the headache is often worse in the morning. This is due to the fact that intracranial pressure tends to increase with recumbency during sleep, leading to increased headache intensity upon awakening. The findings of papillary edema, midline deviation, and signs of tentorial herniation on MRI are indicative of increased intracranial pressure, which correlates with morning predominance of headaches.", "options": {"1": "", "2": "It does not change with effort.", "3": "Predominance in the morning.", "4": "Sonophobia.", "5": "Photophobia."}, "correct_option": 3}
{"question": "What is the treatment of choice for a 38-year-old man diagnosed with Cushing's disease in relation to a pituitary macroadenoma of 22 mm in diameter? The treatment of choice for Cushing's disease caused by a pituitary macroadenoma is the selective surgical resection of the adenoma. This is because surgery directly addresses the source of excess cortisol, which is the pituitary adenoma, and provides the best chance for curing the disease. Other treatments, such as medical therapy, radiotherapy, or adrenalectomy, are generally considered when surgery is contraindicated or unsuccessful. The size of the adenoma (22 mm in this case) generally makes it amenable to surgical removal.", "options": {"1": "Radiotherapy to try to reduce tumor size.", "2": "Adrenalectomy.", "3": "", "4": "Selective surgical resection of the adenoma.", "5": "Initially try medical treatment and, if not effective, resort to surgery."}, "correct_option": 4}

Intestinal transit without alterations. Ultrasound of the abdomen without alterations. Which of the following examinations do you consider most appropriate to complete the study? Given the presence of microcytic anemia (low MCV), low serum iron, and low ferritin levels, this suggests iron deficiency anemia. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy do not reveal significant sources of bleeding, but there might be a small bowel source of blood loss that has not been identified. Therefore, it is essential to explore the small intestine for potential sources of chronic blood loss or other pathology that could explain the anemia. An endoscopic capsule is a non-invasive tool that allows for detailed visualization of the entire small bowel, which could identify small lesions, ulcers, or angiodysplasia that could be causing the iron deficiency.", "options": {"1": "Radioisotopes.", "2": "Pelvic MRI.", "3": "Jejunum biopsy.", "4": "Endoscopic capsule.", "5": "Arteriography."}, "correct_option": 4}

Four days later, she suddenly presents hypotension that requires vigorous volume support, initiation of vasoactive drugs, orotracheal intubation and connection to mechanical ventilation. Physical examination revealed a murmur not previously present. Suspecting a mechanical complication of the infarction, transthoracic echocardiography showed pericardial effusion. Mark the CORRECT answer: Free wall rupture, a mechanical complication of myocardial infarction, typically presents without palpable frÃ©mito (thrill). This condition can lead to pericardial effusion and subsequent cardiac tamponade, which are noted on the echocardiogram and align with the patientâs sudden hypotension and the new murmur.", "options": {"1": "In case of free wall rupture, there is an oxymetric jump in the right ventricle in the Swan-Ganz catheterization.", "2": "Mortality with medical treatment is 20%.", "3": "Mechanical complications usually appear on the first post-infarction day.", "4": "", "5": "In case of free wall rupture, there is no palpable frÃ©mito."}, "correct_option": 5}

The next day the patient alerts at 03 hours in the morning because the patient makes a strange noise when breathing in, like a soft snoring, the patient is sound asleep and very sweaty, but does not seem to be fatigued. What is the most correct attitude? The patient's symptoms of making strange noises when breathing in, excessive sweating, and being in a sound sleep but with a history of myasthenia gravis and recent difficulties suggest a possible progression to acute respiratory failure. In myasthenia gravis, respiratory muscle weakness can lead to life-threatening situations, so it is critical to assess the patient's respiratory status immediately.

Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities. The abdominal X-ray showed dilatation of the small bowel loops, without gas in the rectal ampulla. Regarding this case it is true that: The combination of the patient's history of prior abdominal surgery (appendectomy), recent onset of symptoms including vomiting, abdominal distension, tympanism, increased bowel sounds, and the radiographic findings of dilated small bowel loops with an absence of gas in the rectal ampulla suggests a mechanical small bowel obstruction, likely due to adhesions. Initial management of small bowel obstruction, especially when there is no evidence of strangulation or peritonitis, should be conservative and include intravenous fluids to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, nasogastric aspiration to decompress the bowel, and close clinical, analytical, and radiographic monitoring to assess for resolution or progression of the obstruction.", "options": {"1": "The fact that the patient presented a diarrheal stool allows us to exclude the diagnosis of intestinal obstruction.

The syndromic diagnosis of acute monoarthritis is made. What is the most likely etiologic diagnosis? The presentation of acute monoarthritis characterized by pain, swelling, fever, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein, along with physical examination findings of inflammatory signs and joint effusion, strongly suggests an infectious etiology.

Which treatment would be the treatment of choice? The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with Frey's syndrome, which occurs due to aberrant regeneration of the auriculotemporal nerve fibers after parotid surgery. These fibers abnormally reinnervate sweat glands, leading to sweating, redness, and pain in the affected area during chewing. Intradermal botulinum toxin injection is considered the treatment of choice as it effectively blocks the release of acetylcholine from the nerve endings, thereby reducing the symptoms of Frey's syndrome.", "options": {"1": "Broad-spectrum antibiotherapy.", "2": "Extended total parotidectomy on suspicion of tumor recurrence.", "3": "Intradermal botulinum toxin injection.", "4": "Pregabalin.", "5": ""}, "correct_option": 3}

The patient maintains good visual acuity. Where would you most likely locate the lesion? The clinical presentation of palpebral ptosis, anisocoria with the affected eye demonstrating a smaller pupil (miosis), and preserved visual acuity suggests Horner's syndrome. Horner's syndrome results from a disruption of the sympathetic pathways, which can occur at various points from the hypothalamus to the eye. Given the acute onset of symptoms and their nature, the lesion is most likely located in the superior cervical ganglion, which is part of the sympathetic pathway involved in controlling pupil size and eyelid elevation. This matches with the appearance and evolution of Horner's syndrome symptoms following activities that may strain the neck such as a tennis match.", "options": {"1": "III cranial pair.", "2": "Spinal bulb.", "3": "Superior cervical ganglion.", "4": "Optic chiasm.", "5": ""}, "correct_option": 2}

Of the following, which is the most probable cause of his renal failure? The patient's presentation of general malaise, arthralgias, and a skin rash following treatment with ciprofloxacin is suggestive of a drug reaction. The drop in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 100 ml/min to 45 ml/min within six months, and the presence of leukocytes in the urine sediment without nitrites, strongly indicate acute interstitial nephritis (AIN).

In view of these data, what is the most likely diagnosis? The presence of cognitive impairment, visual hallucinations, and worsening motor symptoms after administration of a neuroleptic like risperidone are strongly indicative of dementia with Lewy bodies.

Which of the following entities is more likely to be present? The presence of proteinuria (6.3 g/24 h) in a patient with normal blood pressure, absence of edema, and normal serum albumin level suggests a glomerular disease. The patient's obesity and mild hypertension may contribute to the development of a glomerular disease.

What is the most likely diagnosis and what treatment would you prescribe? The patient's symptoms of pain and stiffness in the shoulder girdle and pelvic girdle, which worsen with inactivity and improve with mobilization, are consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica. The laboratory tests showing elevated ESR and C-reactive protein support this diagnosis, as they indicate an inflammatory process. Furthermore, the absence of fever, headache, and general condition, as well as the lack of joint swelling or deformity, make other possibilities such as rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis less likely.

The patient maintains good visual acuity, where would you most likely locate the lesion? The patient's symptoms, including neck pain, gait instability, and palpebral ptosis of the left eye, suggest a lesion affecting the sympathetic pathway and the oculomotor nerve. The anisocoria, with the left pupil being smaller than the right, is also consistent with a sympathetic pathway lesion, as the sympathetic fibers responsible for pupillary dilation originate in the upper cervical ganglion and ascend through the neck.

The patient's history of irregular adherence to antiretroviral treatment and recent good control of HIV (CD4 lymphocytes 350 cells/mL and HIV viral load of 154 copies/mL) makes it unlikely that the manifestations are due to HIV itself. The polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and the absence of liver cirrhosis make C virus-associated cirrhosis unlikely. The patient's history of prednisone treatment for seronegative symmetrical polyarthritis does not justify the pancytopenia.

He smoked 30 cig/day, was not obese, his blood pressure was 145/90 mm Hg and he did not have diabetes. When asked about family history, he mentioned that an uncle on his mother's side died suddenly at 53 years of age. Which answer do you agree with the most? The patient's lipid profile is highly atherogenic, with elevated LDL and low HDL, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Given the patient's history of acute myocardial infarction, it is essential to rule out secondary causes of dyslipidemia, such as hypothyroidism, to ensure that the treatment is comprehensive. A family study is also necessary to identify potential familial hypercholesterolemia, which would require a more aggressive approach to lipid-lowering therapy. Statins are the most effective medications for reducing LDL levels and have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Therefore, treatment with statins to achieve a good lipid profile, along with control of other risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension, and encouragement of a healthy lifestyle, is the most appropriate course of action.", "options": {"1": "Rule out secondary dyslipidemia, treat with resins (resincholestyramine) and fibrates and re-commend a healthy lifestyle.

The blood test showed blood glucose 450 mg/dl, Na 142 mEq/l, K 4 mEq/l, pH 7.15, bicarbonate 12 mmol/l. Which treatment would NOT be indicated? The patient is presenting with signs of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte imbalance. The goal of treatment is to correct dehydration, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalance. Sodium bicarbonate is not indicated in the treatment of DKA unless the pH is severely acidic (<6.9), which is not the case here.

The ECG shows sinus rhythm at 72 bpm, with criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy and inverted T waves in anterior face. Point out the correct statement: The presence of a loud, intense systolic murmur that decreases with Valsalva maneuvers suggests that the murmur is dynamic and obstructive, which is consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Additionally, the ECG findings of left ventricular hypertrophy and inverted T waves in the anterior leads support this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of syncope during exertion are also consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as it can cause obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract, leading to decreased cardiac output and syncope.", "options": {"1": "", "2": "Aortic dissection should be excluded by contrast-enhanced computed tomography.", "3": "The data provided indicate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with severe obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract.", "4": "The clinical picture suggests pulmonary thromboembolism.", "5": "These data correspond to severe aortic stenosis."}, "correct_option": 5}

The next day the patient alerts at 03 hours in the morning because the patient makes a strange noise when breathing in, like a soft snoring, the patient is sound asleep and very sweaty, but does not seem to be fatigued. What is the most correct attitude? The patient's symptoms, such as the strange noise when breathing in, like a soft snoring, and excessive sweating, are suggestive of respiratory muscle weakness, which is a red flag for potential respiratory failure. Myasthenia gravis is a disease that affects the neuromuscular junction, and weakness of the respiratory muscles can lead to respiratory failure, especially in a patient who was previously asymptomatic and is now experiencing a myasthenic crisis.

The examination revealed two lymphadenopathies, one in each groin, 1 cm in diameter, soft, mobile, non-painful. No skin lesions are seen on the lower limbs, anus or perineum. Which test do you consider essential? The patient presents with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathies without any local discomfort or suggestive symptoms of sexually transmitted infection. Given the lack of specific symptoms and the soft, mobile, and non-painful nature of the lymph nodes, it is essential to rule out malignancy, particularly melanoma, as it can present with similar symptoms.

X-ray shows a displaced subcapital fracture of the right hip. What is the recommended treatment? In a 95-year-old patient with a displaced subcapital fracture of the right hip, the recommended treatment is hip hemiarthroplasty. This is because the patient is independent for her basic activities of daily living and has a good functional status, which suggests that she would benefit from a prompt surgical intervention to restore her mobility and prevent complications related to immobility.

She has no symptoms, physical examination is unremarkable, chest X-ray is normal. CT scan shows a 3 cm mass in the right hepatic lobe that is captured on PET. No other alterations are observed in CT or PET. What is the most correct approach? The patient presents with a solitary liver metastasis, which is a common site of recurrence for colon cancer. The elevated CEA level and PET scan findings confirm the metastatic nature of the lesion.

The syndromic diagnosis of acute monoarthritis is made. What is the most likely etiologic diagnosis? The patient's symptoms, such as fever, inflammatory signs, and joint effusion, suggest an infectious etiology. The laboratory results, including leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated C-reactive protein, further support this diagnosis. The acute onset and monoarticular involvement also point towards an infectious cause. Among the possible infectious etiologies, bacterial infectious arthritis is the most likely diagnosis due to the patient's young age, the presence of fever, and the rapid development of symptoms.", "options": {"1": "Rheumatoid arthritis.", "2": "Bacterial infectious arthritis.", "3": "Mycobacterial infectious arthritis.", "4": "Arthritis due to microcrystals.", "5": "Reactive arthritis."}, "correct_option": 2}

What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient's condition? The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with liver damage, as evidenced by the presence of jaundice, painful hepatomegaly, and abnormal liver function tests, including elevated bilirubin, AST, ALT, and GGT levels. The patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption and recent increase in drinking due to family problems suggests a direct link between the liver damage and alcohol abuse. Furthermore, the presence of asterixis, a flapping tremor of the hands, is a common finding in patients with liver encephalopathy, which is often seen in patients with severe liver damage. The patient's abnormal coagulation profile, as indicated by the prolonged prothrombin time, is also consistent with liver dysfunction.

Which of the following would be WRONG: Immediate gynecological examination with cervical cytology would be incorrect because the patient's physical and emotional well-being should be prioritized first. The patient is already showing signs of distress, and performing an immediate examination may exacerbate her emotional state. Additionally, the patient's inconsistent and slow responses suggest that she may not be in a suitable state to provide informed consent for the examination.

The presence of fever, irritability, and bulging fontanel in a 7-month-old child suggests a diagnosis of meningitis. The cerebrospinal fluid study shows a moderate pleocytosis with a lymphocytic predominance, which is more consistent with a viral meningitis. However, the protein level is elevated, and the glucose level is low compared to serum glycemia, which are features more commonly seen in bacterial meningitis.

What is your diagnostic suspicion: The presence of a mediastinal mass and a hepatic nodule in the CT scan suggests a metastatic disease. The elevation of LDH, beta-HCG, and alpha-fetoprotein in the CBC indicates that the tumor is producing these oncofetal proteins, which is a characteristic of germ cell tumors. The combination of these markers, particularly the elevation of beta-HCG, suggests a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor, as seminomas typically do not produce alpha-fetoprotein.

Which of the following drugs would you use in the first line for the treatment of her pathology? The patient's symptoms are consistent with diabetic neuropathy, specifically peripheral neuropathy. The first-line treatment for diabetic neuropathy is typically a medication that targets the neuropathic pain and discomfort, rather than just analgesia. In this case, a medication that has been shown to be effective in managing diabetic neuropathy is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which has a dual mechanism of action that helps to reduce the neuropathic pain and discomfort, as well as improve sleep quality.", "options": {"1": "Oxycodone.", "2": "Ibuprofen.", "3": "", "4": "Duloxetine.", "5": "Paracetamol."}, "correct_option": 4}

She has a magnetic resonance imaging study in which the rotator cuff is undamaged. What is the most likely diagnosis of suspicion? The patient's inability to abduct the shoulder beyond 15 degrees and the presence of dysesthesia in the lateral region of the shoulder are indicative of a nerve injury. The fact that the rotator cuff is undamaged, as shown by the MRI, rules out a musculoskeletal cause. The axillary nerve is responsible for innervating the deltoid muscle, which is responsible for shoulder abduction.

In the treatment with ibuprofen (600 mg every 8 h) and tramadol (150 mg per day), what treatment would you consider most appropriate in this patient to improve the pain? The patient is experiencing intense bone pain and exacerbations of pain, indicating that the current treatment with ibuprofen and tramadol is not adequate. Given the severity of the pain, a major opioid such as morphine or oxycodone should be considered.

Soï¬a apologizes for not knowing that she should have her cell phone turned off, and after turning it off, asks if she can make a friend request on Facebook. What do you think is Juan's best response? A doctor-patient relationship is based on trust, respect, and professional boundaries. As a healthcare provider, Juan has a responsibility to maintain a professional distance from his patients, especially a vulnerable adolescent like Sofia who may be experiencing emotional distress. Accepting a friend request or engaging in social media interactions with Sofia could blur these boundaries and create potential conflicts of interest, compromising Juan's ability to provide objective care.

The most likely rationale for these findings is due to: The liver enzymes, specifically GPT, alkaline phosphatase, and alpha-2-globulin, are elevated, indicating liver dysfunction. The prothrombin time is also prolonged, suggesting a coagulopathy. The liver is diffusely enlarged, but there is no evidence of hepatic infiltration or metastases.

With the CBC data, what would be your diagnostic suspicion even without having the patient's biochemistry? The presence of microcytic and hypochromic anemia with a decreased hemoglobin content in reticulocytes and a low absolute reticulocyte count suggests a defect in hemoglobin synthesis or iron utilization. The discrete thrombocytosis is also consistent with this hypothesis.

The patient is referred to the genetic counseling office where a possible chorionic villus biopsy to study the fetal genotype is evaluated. Is this invasive procedure indicated as a pre-natal diagnosis (PND) in this case? Since the brother of the Consultant has an expansive mutation of 70 CAG repeats in the SCA3 gene, which is an autosomal dominant disorder, there is a 50% chance of transmission of the mutated gene to the offspring. The Consultant, being the sibling of the affected brother, has a 50% chance of being a carrier of the mutated gene.

What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? The patient's history of slow progressive evolution of memory impairment, especially with difficulties in daily activities such as remembering insulin doses, and the presence of diffuse cortical atrophy predominantly in the posterior area on MRI, suggest a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The absence of hallucinations, behavioral disorder, neurological focality, tremor, tone or gait disorders on physical examination, and the lack of new information on the CT scan after a mild traumatic brain injury, further support this diagnosis.

Indicate which diagnostic tests would be necessary to confirm the most likely diagnosis: The patient's laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, a type of plasma cell cancer that can cause bone fractures and abnormalities in blood tests. The presence of anemia (low hemoglobin), hypoproteinemia (low total proteins), and hypoalbuminemia (low serum albumin) are consistent with this diagnosis. The elevated beta 2 microglobulin level also supports this diagnosis, as it is a tumor marker for multiple myeloma.

Molecular diagnosis indicates that the index case is homozygous for the F5O8del mutation and his parents are heterozygous carriers. The clinical geneticist will inform them about the mode of transmission of the disease. Which statement is correct? In this case, the index case is homozygous for the F5O8del mutation, and both parents are heterozygous carriers. This means that each parent has one normal allele and one mutated allele. When they reproduce, each parent has a 50% chance of passing on the mutated allele and a 50% chance of passing on the normal allele. Therefore, the probability that the next offspring will inherit one mutated allele from each parent (homozygous affected) is 25% (50% x 50%), the probability that the next offspring will inherit one mutated allele from one parent (heterozygous carrier) is 50% (50% x 50% + 50% x 50%), and the probability that the next offspring will inherit two normal alleles (homozygous normal) is 25% (50% x 50%).", "options": {"1": "", "2": "Having had a homozygous F5O8del child, the next offspring will be heterozygous carriers (67%) or homozygous genotype without the mutation (33%).", "3": "The probability that the next offspring will be affected is 50%.", "4": "The probability that the next offspring will be affected is 25%.", "5": "Having had an affected child, the next offspring will also be affected."}, "correct_option": 4}

Laboratory data: hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL ferritin 450 ng/mL erythrocyte sedimentation rate 115 mm/h. What is the most appropriate immediate action in this patient? The patient's symptoms, such as acute vision loss, fever, pain in the shoulders, neck, and hips, and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, ferritin), are highly suggestive of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent permanent vision loss. The patient's age, symptoms, and laboratory results are all consistent with GCA.

The patient's symptoms, such as severe tremor, ataxia, dysarthria, myoclonus, and fasciculations, are indicative of lithium toxicity. Given the elevated lithium level of 4.1 mEq/L, which is well above the toxic threshold of 1.6 mEq/L, a therapeutic option that can rapidly remove lithium from the bloodstream is necessary. Lithium is a small ion that can be effectively removed by hemodialysis, which can reduce the serum lithium level quickly and efficiently.

The patient is asymptomatic, has a good functional status (ECOG 0), and the lymphoma is not causing any significant hematological or organ dysfunction. The tumor burden is relatively low, with lymphadenopathies less than 3 cm. In this scenario, a watch-and-wait approach is a reasonable strategy, as it allows for delaying chemotherapy and its potential toxicities until symptoms or significant disease progression occur.

What is the most likely diagnosis? The patient's symptoms, specifically the appearance of pubic hair, are consistent with an androgen-mediated process. The bone age being one year older than the chronological age suggests some degree of acceleration of growth, but the lack of increase in testicular volume and penis size, as well as the normal growth rate, make central precocious puberty unlikely. The presence of pubic hair without other signs of virilization, such as penile growth or testicular enlargement, points to an adrenal source of androgens, which is consistent with early adrenarche.", "options": {"1": "Peripheral precocious puberty.", "2": "Adrenal tumor.", "3": "Central precocious puberty.", "4": "", "5": "Early adrenarche."}, "correct_option": 5}

The patient presents with a 15-day fever, painful hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly, which suggests a lymphoproliferative or infectious process. The blood count shows pancytopenia, with a predominance of lymphocytes and monocytes, which is not typical of HIV infection or antiretroviral treatment toxicity. The patient's history of irregular adherence to antiretroviral treatment and recent good control of HIV (CD4 lymphocytes 350 cells/mL and HIV viral load of 154 copies/mL) makes it unlikely that the manifestations are due to HIV itself. The polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and the absence of liver cirrhosis make C virus-associated cirrhosis unlikely.

{"question": "A 47-year-old woman consults for voiding syndrome. She is diagnosed with uncomplicated urinary tract infection and treated with ciprofloxacin for 5 days. A week later, she consulted again for general malaise, arthralgias and the appearance of a skin rash. In the analytical analysis, the glomerular filtration rate was 45 ml/min (CKD-EPI), whereas 6 months ago it was 100 ml/min. In the sediment leukocytes are identified, being negative for nitrites. Of the following, which is the most probable cause of his renal failure? The patient developed acute kidney injury (AKI) after taking ciprofloxacin for 5 days, which is a common antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections. The absence of nitrites in the urine sediment and the presence of leukocytes suggest that the AKI is not related to a bacterial infection. The rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate (from 100 ml/min to 45 ml/min) and the presence of a skin rash and arthralgias are consistent with an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, which is a known side effect of ciprofloxacin. This reaction can cause acute interstitial nephritis, a type of kidney injury that is often reversible if the offending agent is removed.", "options": {"1": "", "2": "Postinfectious glomerulonephritis.", "3": "Ciprofloxacin nephrotoxicity.", "4": "Acute pyelonephritis.", "5": "Acute interstitial nephritis."}, "correct_option": 5}

The most correct initial treatment would be to administer: The patient is presenting with symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as dyspnea, hoarseness, rash, nausea, and vomiting, which is a life-threatening allergic reaction. The patient's history of taking metamizole, a known allergenic medication, and the rapid onset of symptoms after taking the medication support this diagnosis. The patient's hypotension and low oxygen saturation further emphasize the severity of the situation. Adrenaline is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, as it helps to rapidly reverse the symptoms by constricting blood vessels, relaxing smooth muscle, and improving cardiac function. Additionally, dexchlorpheniramine, an antihistamine, can help to alleviate symptoms related to histamine release.

The symptoms of pain in the posterior aspect of the right lower limb extending to the foot, decreased strength in plantar flexion of the right foot, and hypoesthesia in the external border of the right foot suggest an S1 nerve root compression. The absence of right Achilles reflex further supports this conclusion, as the Achilles reflex is mediated by the S1 nerve root.

She takes 5 medications regularly. Which of the following is most likely to contribute to falls in this patient? The patient's history of depression and the fact that he takes 5 medications regularly, including an antidepressant, suggest that the fall is related to a medication that can cause sedation, confusion, or impairment of cognitive function. This medication is likely to contribute to falls in this patient because it can affect the central nervous system, leading to impaired balance, coordination, and reaction time.

What would be the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent an emboligenic stroke with anticoagulation therapy: The number needed to treat (NNT) is calculated as the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). The ARR is the difference between the event rate in the control group and the event rate in the treatment group. In this case, the event rate in the control group (without warfarin) is 5.2% and the event rate in the treatment group (with warfarin) is 2.2%. The ARR is therefore 5.2% - 2.2% = 3%.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute leukemia with t(15;17) in 60% of the cells, which is a characteristic genetic abnormality of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). APL is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that is known to be associated with a high risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The laboratory results, such as low platelet count and elevated D-dimer, suggest that the patient is already experiencing coagulopathy. Therefore, it is essential to initiate treatment promptly to control the DIC and prevent further complications. In APL, the standard treatment includes all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide, which have been shown to be effective in inducing remission and reducing the risk of DIC.

Taking into account the most probable diagnosis in the clinical picture described, what is the complementary test of choice to confirm this clinical diagnosis? The clinical picture suggests a diagnosis of pyloric stenosis, which is a common cause of vomiting in infants. The \"squirting\" food content and permanent hunger are indicative of a gastric outlet obstruction. The blood gas analysis shows a metabolic alkalosis, which is consistent with the loss of hydrochloric acid and potassium in the vomit. The complementary test of choice to confirm this diagnosis would be an imaging study that can visualize the pylorus and rule out other causes of gastric outlet obstruction. An imaging study that can demonstrate the hypertrophic pylorus and the length of the pyloric channel is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.", "options": {"1": "pHmetry.", "2": "Determination of electrolytes in sweat.", "3": "Simple abdominal X-ray.", "4": "Esophagogastroscopy.", "5": "Abdominal ultrasound."}, "correct_option": 5}

Which treatment would be the treatment of choice? The symptoms presented by the patient, such as pain, sweating, and reddening of the skin in the preauricular region during chewing, are characteristic of Frey's syndrome, a known complication of parotid surgery. This syndrome is caused by aberrant regeneration of parasympathetic nerve fibers, which normally innervate the parotid gland, and instead innervate the sweat glands of the skin.

Twenty days after starting treatment, a report of rifampicin resistance of M. tuberculosis isolated in sputum is received. Which regimen would you select based on this report? Rifampicin is a crucial component of the initial treatment regimen for pulmonary tuberculosis, and its resistance necessitates a change in the treatment strategy. Since the patient has already received 20 days of treatment, it is reasonable to assume that the other medications, namely isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, have been effective in reducing the bacterial load.

Of the following statements, which would be the most correct diagnostic and therapeutic approach? The patient's presentation is consistent with a severe case of infectious mononucleosis, as evidenced by the positive Paul-Bunnell test and IgM for Epstein-Barr virus. The development of pancytopenia, icteric hepatitis, and coagulopathy suggests a hemophagocytic syndrome, which is a known complication of infectious mononucleosis. The elevated ferritin levels and normal procalcitonin support this diagnosis. The absence of bacterial growth in blood and urine cultures, as well as the normal CSF and chest x-ray, make bacterial sepsis unlikely.

Several males of the maternal family had died in childhood due to infectious processes. The examination showed typical lesions of atopic dermatitis. The immunological study showed a slight decrease in T lymphocyte subpopulations; elevated IgA and IgE; decreased IgM and IgG at the lower limit of normal. What is the most likely diagnosis? The patient's history of recurrent infections, including otitis media, meningitis, and pneumonias, suggests an immunodeficiency disorder. The presence of thrombocytopenic purpura, atopic dermatitis, and a family history of males dying in childhood due to infections further support this diagnosis. The immunological study showing a slight decrease in T lymphocyte subpopulations, elevated IgA and IgE, and decreased IgM and IgG at the lower limit of normal is consistent with a specific immunodeficiency disorder that affects both T and B cell function, and is characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections.

In the last 2 months, onset of diarrhea with loss of 4 kg of weight. What is the most correct diagnostic approach? The patient's symptoms of lumbosacral pain with inflammatory rhythm, bilateral thalalgia, and morning stiffness suggest a diagnosis of spondyloarthritis. Additionally, the onset of diarrhea and weight loss in the last 2 months raises the suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease, which is a common comorbidity with spondyloarthritis.

Liver, pancreas, adrenal, spleen and kidneys without significant findings. Paracentesis is performed through a thick needle, obtaining with difficulty a somewhat yellowish, dense and gelatinous fluid. What is the most probable etiology? The presence of a gelatinous fluid obtained through paracentesis, along with the patient's symptoms and ultrasound/CT scan findings, suggests a high likelihood of chylous ascites. This type of ascites is characterized by the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the peritoneal cavity, which is typically yellowish, dense, and gelatinous in consistency. The absence of peritoneal implants or abdominal/pelvic masses on imaging, as well as the lack of significant liver or pancreatic disease, makes malignancy-related causes less likely.", "options": {"1": "Hydropic decompensation secondary to liver cirrhosis.", "2": "Ascites secondary to constrictive pericarditis.", "3": "Chylous ascites due to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "4": "Peritoneal metastasis of adenocarcinoma.", "5": "Peritoneal tuberculosis."}, "correct_option": 3}

The pain appears when the lower limb is lifted with the knee extended, but is relieved when the knee is flexed. What is the first clinical suspicion? The pain that appears when the lower limb is lifted with the knee extended and relieved when the knee is flexed is a classic finding in Lasegue's sign, which is a hallmark of lumbar disc herniation or sciatica. The radiation of pain from the buttock to the lateral thigh and knee is also consistent with this diagnosis.

The most appropriate approach in this case is: The symptoms described, such as purplish-red, hot, painful, bilateral subcutaneous nodules of pretibial location, are consistent with erythema nodosum, a cutaneous manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly Crohn's disease. The patient's recent exacerbation of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as increased stools and abdominal pain, further supports this diagnosis.

Which of the following is the most likely location of the primary tumor: The presence of squamous cell carcinoma in a lymph node, particularly in the jugulodigastric region, suggests that the primary tumor is located in the head and neck region. The patient's history of smoking and heavy drinking also increases the likelihood of a head and neck cancer. The absence of symptoms related to the primary tumor, such as dysphagia or hoarseness, makes it less likely that the primary tumor is located in the esophagus or larynx. The parotid gland is also an unlikely location, as it is typically associated with adenocarcinoma or lymphoma, rather than squamous cell carcinoma. The scalp is a possible location, but it is less common than another location in the head and neck region that is closely related to the jugulodigastric lymph node. Therefore, the most likely location of the primary tumor is in the upper aerodigestive tract, specifically in the oropharynx or nasopharynx, which commonly metastasize to the jugulodigastric lymph node.", "options": {"1": "Scalp.", "2": "Larynx.", "3": "Lung.", "4": "Parotid.", "5": "Esophagus."}, "correct_option": 2}

CBC: blood glucose 420 mg/dL, Na+ 131 mEq/L, K+ normal, pH 7.08, bicarbonate 8 mEq/L and ketonuria (+++) Which answer do you think is more correct? The patient's symptoms of polydipsia, polyuria, and weight loss, along with the laboratory results of high blood glucose (420 mg/dL), ketonuria (+++), and acidosis (pH 7.08, bicarbonate 8 mEq/L) are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis.

Which of the following is a poor prognostic factor after surgical resection and should be taken into account when planning chemotherapy treatment? Perforation or adhesion of the tumor to adjacent organs is a poor prognostic factor after surgical resection and should be taken into account when planning chemotherapy treatment because it indicates a higher likelihood of tumor cells having breached the bowel wall and potentially entered the lymphatic or bloodstream, increasing the risk of recurrence and metastasis. This factor is a key consideration in determining the aggressiveness of the tumor and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy to reduce the risk of relapse.", "options": {"1": "The presence of anemia at diagnosis.", "2": "The existence of a family history of colorectal cancer.", "3": "Perforation or adhesion of the tumor to adjacent organs.", "4": "", "5": "The size of the primary lesion and histological differentiation."}, "correct_option": 3}

The patient's condition is characterized by significant functional impotence, limited mobility, and continuous pain, despite the use of antirheumatic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic medication. This suggests that conservative management has failed to provide adequate relief. Given the patient's advanced age and severe symptoms, a more definitive surgical solution is warranted.

She does not take any medication except occasional ibuprofen for muscle pain after sports activities. The CBC shows increased bilirubin at the expense of direct bilirubin. An urgent ultrasound shows a normal liver, vesicular cholesterosis and absence of bile duct dilatation, with no other alterations of interest. What is the most likely diagnosis? The patient presents with jaundice, choluria, and acholia, indicating a cholestatic picture. The absence of abdominal pain, weight loss, and other symptoms, along with the normal liver and vesicular cholesterosis on ultrasound, points towards an obstructive cause. The absence of bile duct dilatation makes a mechanical obstruction unlikely, such as cholangiocarcinoma or biliary mud. The patient's history of taking ibuprofen occasionally for muscle pain after sports activities does not suggest a toxic hepatitis. Gilbert's syndrome is a benign condition characterized by mild, intermittent jaundice, usually triggered by fasting, stress, or infection, which matches the patient's presentation.", "options": {"1": "Acute cholangitis due to biliary mud.", "2": "Gilbert's syndrome.", "3": "Cholangiocarcinoma.", "4": "Toxic hepatitis due to ibuprofen.", "5": ""}, "correct_option": 4}

The treatment to be indicated for this patient is: The patient presents with dyspnea on medium exertion and a significant aortic transvalvular gradient, indicating severe aortic stenosis. The calculated area of 0.7 cmÂ² is also consistent with severe aortic stenosis. The ejection fraction of 65% suggests that the left ventricle is still functioning well. In this scenario, medical therapy is unlikely to improve the patient's symptoms, and a definitive treatment is required.

What would be the appropriate attitude? The pleural fluid analysis suggests a transudative effusion, as the LDH is low and the protein ratio is less than 0.5, indicating that the fluid is not inflammatory in nature. This, combined with the patient's underlying liver cirrhosis and ascites, points towards a hepatic hydrothorax, which is a transudative pleural effusion that occurs due to the passage of ascitic fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the pleural space through a diaphragmatic defect.

{"question": "A 60-year-old man reports precordial pain after medium exertion. Coronary angiography shows significant stenosis in the proximal segments of the three main vessels with good distal bed. Ventricular function is depressed (<30%). What is the best therapeutic option? The patient has significant stenosis in the proximal segments of the three main vessels, which indicates a high risk of cardiac events and mortality. Additionally, the depressed ventricular function (30%) suggests a high-risk patient. In this scenario, the best therapeutic option is to revascularize the myocardium to improve blood flow and reduce the risk of cardiac events. Percutaneous revascularization may not be sufficient to revascularize all the affected vessels, and medical treatment alone may not be enough to improve ventricular function. Implantation of a balloon counterpulsation is a temporary measure to support the heart, but it is not a definitive solution. Cardiac transplantation is not indicated in this case, as the patient's heart failure is reversible with revascularization.

In the gynecological examination she only shows pain when pressing on the posterior vaginal fornix. Which test do you consider would allow you to reach a diagnosis of certainty of her pathology? The patient's symptoms, including dyspareunia, dyschezia, and rectal bleeding, are strongly suggestive of endometriosis, particularly with the presence of pain on palpation of the posterior vaginal fornix.

The patient presents with sudden onset of clinical aphasia and right hemiparesis, which are symptoms of acute ischemic stroke. Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation, the most likely etiology is an embolic stroke. The patient is within the 45-minute time window for thrombolysis, which is a proven treatment for acute ischemic stroke.

The patient's history of smoking and heavy drinking also increases the likelihood of a head and neck cancer. The absence of symptoms related to the primary tumor, such as dysphagia or hoarseness, makes it less likely that the primary tumor is located in the esophagus or larynx. The parotid gland is also an unlikely location, as it is typically associated with adenocarcinoma or lymphoma, rather than squamous cell carcinoma. The scalp is a possible location, but it is less common than another location in the head and neck region that is closely related to the jugulodigastric lymph node.

Cervical palpation is negative for lymphadenopathy. What is your presumptive diagnosis and course of action? The patient's symptoms, such as odynodysphagia and otalgia, suggest a problem in the oropharyngeal region. The dentist's report rules out a dental cause. The physical examination reveals a stony hard induration at the base of the tongue, which is highly suspicious of a malignant process. The absence of lymphadenopathy on cervical palpation does not rule out a malignant process, as it may be a primary lesion without metastasis. The normal head and neck CAT scan without iodine contrast does not exclude a malignant process, as it may not be visible without contrast.

What strategy do you think is most appropriate? The patient presents with clear symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as asthenia, hoarse voice, slow speech, and swelling of the hands, feet, and face. The laboratory results confirm this diagnosis, with elevated TSH and decreased Free T4 levels. Before starting treatment, it is essential to identify the underlying cause of hypothyroidism. In this case, since there is no evidence of thyroiditis or thyroid cancer, it is likely that the patient has primary hypothyroidism.

Which treatment would be the treatment of choice? The symptoms presented by the patient, such as pain, sweating, and reddening of the skin in the preauricular region during chewing, are characteristic of Frey's syndrome, a known complication of parotid surgery. This syndrome is caused by aberrant regeneration of parasympathetic nerve fibers, which normally innervate the parotid gland, and instead innervate the sweat glands of the skin.

One hour after arrival at the emergency room, BP 70/55 mm Hg persists. What would be the most appropriate initial treatment? The patient presents with syncope, dyspnea, and hypotension, which are indicative of a high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE). The ECG and thoracic CT angiography support this diagnosis, with evidence of right ventricular strain and a repletion defect in both main pulmonary arteries, respectively. Given the patient's hemodynamic instability, immediate treatment is necessary to prevent further decompensation.

The patient maintains good visual acuity, where would you most likely locate the lesion? The patient's symptoms, including neck pain, gait instability, and palpebral ptosis of the left eye, suggest a lesion affecting the sympathetic pathway and the oculomotor nerve. The anisocoria, with the left pupil being smaller than the right, is also consistent with a sympathetic pathway lesion, as the sympathetic fibers responsible for pupillary dilation originate in the upper cervical ganglion and ascend through the neck.

The presence of microcytic and hypochromic anemia with a decreased hemoglobin content in reticulocytes and a low absolute reticulocyte count suggests a defect in hemoglobin synthesis or iron utilization. The discrete thrombocytosis is also consistent with this hypothesis. The absence of elevated reticulocytes and the presence of a normal red cell distribution amplitude suggest that the anemia is not due to hemolysis or acute bleeding. The low hemoglobin content in reticulocytes and the microcytic anemia also rule out a deficiency in folic acid or vitamin B12.", "options": {"1": "Central anemia, arregenerative, due to iron deficiency.", "2": "Peripheral anemia, regenerative, due to acute active hemorrhage.", "3": "Peripheral, regenerative, hemolytic anemia.", "4": "Central anemia, arregenerative, due to folic acid deficiency.", "5": "Thalassemic trait."}, "correct_option": 1}

The patient is presenting with signs of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte imbalance. The goal of treatment is to correct dehydration, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalance. Sodium bicarbonate is not indicated in the treatment of DKA unless the pH is severely acidic (<6.9), which is not the case here.

{"question": "A 45-year-old patient was diagnosed with HIV infection three months ago, presenting at that time with CD4 45 lymphocytes/Âµl and an HIV-1 viral load of 500,000 copies/ml. At that time he had a negative Mantoux test. He started treatment with an integrase inhibitor and two reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and at one month he had 25,000 copies and CD4 had risen to 80/ÂµL. She consulted for presenting a picture of cervical lymphadenopathy and fever of two weeks of evolution. The puncture of one of the lymph nodes showed isolated acid-fast bacilli and epithelioid granulomas: The patient's CD4 count has increased, and the viral load has decreased, indicating a good response to antiretroviral therapy. However, the patient has developed new symptoms, specifically cervical lymphadenopathy and fever, which are consistent with an opportunistic infection. The presence of acid-fast bacilli and epithelioid granulomas in the lymph node puncture suggests tuberculosis. This is likely an example of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), where the patient's recovering immune system is responding to a previously acquired opportunistic infection, in this case, tuberculosis.

The day after her return, she goes to her family doctor for high fever, intense arthromyalgia and headache that had started before the return trip and he prescribes her paracetamol. Three days later and with no improvement, he presented in the morning with a generalized pruritic maculo-papular rash, which was more intense on the lower limbs where it developed into petechiae, for which he went to the emergency department. There is no relevant data in the EC except platelets 75000/mm3 (htco 36%, leukocytes 4100 79% neutrophils). What is the most likely diagnosis? The patient's symptoms, such as high fever, intense arthromyalgia, and headache, began before her return trip from Cuba, suggesting an infection acquired during travel. The development of a generalized pruritic maculo-papular rash, more intense on the lower limbs, with petechiae, is consistent with a bleeding disorder. The thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 75,000/mm3) and normal leukocyte count support this diagnosis.

What specific treatment do you consider most appropriate? The patient's symptoms, such as increasing mental dullness, headache, and severe dyspnea, along with the high capillary lactic acid level, suggest cyanide poisoning, which is a common complication of fires involving polyurethane foams. Cyanide toxicity can cause tissue hypoxia, leading to lactic acidosis, and the patient's oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry may be misleadingly normal.

A plain radiograph of the hips shows narrowing of the femoroacetabular joint space, sclerosis and osteophytes. What is your approach? The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with osteoarthritis of the hip, also known as coxarthrosis. The treatment approach should be tailored to the patient's needs, and surgical intervention should be considered only when conservative management fails to provide adequate pain control and functional improvement. Initially, a stepwise approach with pharmacological management, such as paracetamol, and lifestyle modifications should be tried.

His blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, 90% SatO2, capillary glucose 120 mg/dl and respiratory rate 7 rpm. Which initial therapeutic approach do you think is the most correct? The patient's presentation with a normal capillary glucose level and no signs of malnutrition makes it unlikely that hypoglycemia or Wernicke's encephalopathy are the cause of the coma. Therefore, administering thiamine and hypertonic glucose is not the most correct initial approach. The patient's normal blood pressure and respiratory rate also make it unlikely that the coma is due to opioid or benzodiazepine overdose, so administering naloxone and flumazenil may not be necessary. Given the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes, and the absence of any other obvious cause of coma, the most correct initial approach is to consider and rule out other possible causes of coma, such as stroke or other neurological emergencies, and to perform further diagnostic tests to determine the underlying cause of the coma.", "options": {"1": "", "2": "Administer naloxone, flumazenil and hypertonic glucose.", "3": "Administer naloxone and flumazenil.", "4": "Administer naloxone, flumazenil and thiamine.", "5": "Administer thiamine and hypertonic glucose."}, "correct_option": 3}

Which of the following statements is FALSE? The patient's pH is 7.13, which indicates acidosis, and the PaCO2 is 65 mmHg, which is elevated, indicating that the acidosis is primarily respiratory in nature. The bicarbonate level is 27 mmol/liter, which is slightly elevated, indicating a compensatory response to the respiratory acidosis.

She is in good general condition and does not take any other drugs and does not report any drug allergies. Indicate the treatment you would use: The patient's lesion is an erythematous-orange plaque that has ulcerated and is covered with a scab, which is consistent with a cutaneous leishmaniasis. The patient's history of residing in Valencia, where leishmaniasis is endemic, and the fact that the lesion started after an insect bite, further supports this diagnosis.

The aspiration puncture of the hepatic nodule is conclusive for adenocarcinoma. Indicate the best therapeutic option: In this case, the patient has a pancreatic head mass and a hepatic nodule, both diagnosed as adenocarcinoma. The presence of jaundice and biliary dilatation suggests that the pancreatic tumor is causing biliary obstruction. Given the patient's age and the presence of metastasis, a radical surgery is not a feasible option. A palliative approach is more suitable to alleviate the patient's symptoms, particularly the jaundice and pruritus.

The absence of HBeAg and the presence of Anti-HBe suggest that the virus is not actively replicating. The presence of Anti-HBc IgG indicates that the infection is not acute, as IgG antibodies take time to develop.

What would be the appropriate attitude? The pleural fluid analysis suggests a transudative effusion, as the LDH is low and the protein ratio is less than 0.5, indicating that the fluid is not inflammatory in nature. This, combined with the patient's underlying liver cirrhosis and ascites, points towards a hepatic hydrothorax, which is a transudative pleural effusion that occurs due to the passage of ascitic fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the pleural space through a diaphragmatic defect.

In reference to this case, point out the correct diagnosis: The presence of teeth, hairs, and various types of epithelium (intestinal, squamous, and bronchial) in the histopathological study suggests a tumor composed of tissues from multiple germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm), which is a characteristic of teratomas. The fact that embryonic and neuroectodermal elements are also present, and that the tumor is solid-cystic, suggests that it is an immature teratoma, as opposed to a mature teratoma which would have more differentiated tissues.

Taking into account the most probable diagnosis in the clinical picture described, what is the complementary test of choice to confirm this clinical diagnosis? The clinical picture suggests a diagnosis of pyloric stenosis, which is a common cause of vomiting in infants. The \"squirting\" food content and permanent hunger are indicative of a gastric outlet obstruction. The blood gas analysis shows a metabolic alkalosis, which is consistent with the loss of hydrochloric acid and potassium in the vomit.

The patient has a Streptococcus pneumoniae infection with an MIC to penicillin of 0.0125 mg/l, which indicates that the bacteria are sensitive to penicillin. The treatment with penicillin 2 million every 4h is appropriate. The fact that the patient still has a fever on the fifth day does not necessarily mean that the treatment is ineffective. It is possible that the infection is resolving slowly or that there is a complicating factor, such as a pleural empyema, that is contributing to the persistent fever.

The presence of fever, irritability, and bulging fontanel in a 7-month-old child suggests a diagnosis of meningitis. The cerebrospinal fluid study shows a moderate pleocytosis with a lymphocytic predominance, which is more consistent with a viral meningitis. However, the protein level is elevated, and the glucose level is low compared to serum glycemia, which are features more commonly seen in bacterial meningitis.

The patient presents with dysphonia due to paralysis of the left vocal cord, which suggests involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The occupation of the aortopulmonary window on chest X-ray is consistent with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

What do you think is the most correct approach? The patient has an acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to a gastric ulcer, which is a high-risk lesion because it has a visible vessel (platelet thrombus). The patient has already received blood transfusions and is currently hemodynamically stable. In this scenario, the most correct approach is to continue endoscopic treatment to prevent rebleeding, as the patient is still at risk of further bleeding.

He reported a fever of 40ÂºC with chills and shivering, arthromyalgia and headache, for which he started treatment with paracetamol. The symptoms started 24 hours before his return to Spain. Three days later she presented a generalized maculopapular rash that evolved into more intense petechiae on the lower limbs. She presented blood tests with leukopenia with 3,200/mm3 and platelets 91,000/mm3 and severe elevation of aminotransferases. The thick blood drop, peripheral blood smear, PCR and malaria antigen are negative. What is the most likely diagnosis? The patient's symptoms, such as fever, chills, arthromyalgia, and headache, are consistent with a viral infection. The development of a generalized maculopapular rash that evolves into petechiae on the lower limbs suggests a bleeding disorder, which is supported by the presence of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The elevation of aminotransferases indicates liver involvement. The patient's travel history and the negative results of the thick blood drop, peripheral blood smear, PCR, and malaria antigen rule out malaria. The combination of fever, rash, and hemorrhagic manifestations, along with the absence of other explanations, points to a viral hemorrhagic fever, specifically one that is commonly acquired during travel to tropical regions.", "options": {"1": "Saint Louis encephalitis.", "2": "Dengue.", "3": "Coronavirus infection.", "4": "Lymphocytic choriomeningitis.", "5": "Chikungunya virus infection."}, "correct_option": 2}

The best care strategy for this woman is: This patient has a low-grade intraepithelial lesion (L-SIL) on cervico-vaginal cytology, which is a precursor lesion to cervical cancer. Given her high-risk profile, including multiple sexual partners and a history of vaginal infections, it is essential to rule out any underlying high-grade lesions or invasive cancer. Therefore, a colposcopy-directed biopsy is indicated to further evaluate the lesion and determine the appropriate management.

What is the most likely diagnosis? The presence of hematuria after respiratory infections, with dysmorphic red blood cells in the urine, suggests a diagnosis of glomerular disease, specifically IgA nephropathy. The patient's normal creatinine level and relatively low proteinuria also support this diagnosis, as IgA nephropathy often presents with microscopic hematuria and minimal proteinuria.", "options": {"1": "Membranous glomerulonephritis.", "2": "Focal and primary segmental glomerulosclerosis.", "3": "Proliferative and diffuse glomerulonephritis.", "4": "Minimal change nephropathy.", "5": "IgA nephropathy."}, "correct_option": 5}

The next day the patient alerts at 03 hours in the morning because the patient makes a strange noise when breathing in, like a soft snoring, the patient is sound asleep and very sweaty, but does not seem to be fatigued. What is the most correct attitude? The patient's symptoms, such as the strange noise when breathing in, like a soft snoring, and excessive sweating, are suggestive of respiratory muscle weakness, which is a red flag for potential respiratory failure. Myasthenia gravis is a disease that affects the neuromuscular junction, and weakness of the respiratory muscles can lead to respiratory failure, especially in a patient who was previously asymptomatic and is now experiencing a myasthenic crisis.

The etiologic diagnosis was made by culture of a skin biopsy. What is the most likely causative agent of this process? The patient's symptoms, such as progressive, mildly painful skin lesions on his left arm, starting from an erythematous lesion on his left thumb, and visible reddish striae as connecting lines between the lesions, are consistent with a lymphocutaneous infection. The fact that the patient had been working in his garden and did not remember any injuries suggests an inoculation of the pathogen through a minor trauma.

The most appropriate attitude at this time would be: The patient's persistent fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis despite 4 days of antibiotic therapy and absolute diet suggest that the infection is not being controlled, and the gallbladder is still a source of infection. In this scenario, it is necessary to drain the gallbladder to remove the infected bile and stones, which is not possible with antibiotic therapy alone.

Biopsies of the distal esophagus reveal that the normal squamous epithelium has been replaced by intestinal-type columnar epithelium with low-grade dysplasia What is the most appropriate management option for this patient? The patient has Barrett's esophagus with low-grade dysplasia, which requires close surveillance to detect any potential progression to adenocarcinoma. Since the esophagitis is mild, treatment with PPIs is necessary to control symptoms and prevent further damage. However, there is no evidence that high-dose PPIs prevent progression to adenocarcinoma, and indefinite treatment is necessary.

At that time he had a negative Mantoux test. He started treatment with an integrase inhibitor and two reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and at one month he had 25,000 copies and CD4 had risen to 80/ÂµL. She consulted for presenting a picture of cervical lymphadenopathy and fever of two weeks of evolution. The puncture of one of the lymph nodes showed isolated acid-fast bacilli and epithelioid granulomas: The patient's CD4 count has increased, and the viral load has decreased, indicating a good response to antiretroviral therapy. However, the patient has developed new symptoms, specifically cervical lymphadenopathy and fever, which are consistent with an opportunistic infection. The presence of acid-fast bacilli and epithelioid granulomas in the lymph node puncture suggests tuberculosis. This is likely an example of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), where the patient's recovering immune system is responding to a previously acquired opportunistic infection, in this case, tuberculosis. The negative Mantoux test at the time of HIV diagnosis does not rule out the possibility of tuberculosis, as it may have been anergic due to the patient's immunosuppressed state.", "options": {"1": "This is an opportunistic infection unmasked within a picture of immune reconstitution.", "2": "A negative Mantoux test rules out tuberculosis.", "3": "Treatment failure and it is an opportunistic infection.", "4": "It is a lymph node tuberculosis related to an incomplete immunologic recovery.", "5": ""}, "correct_option": 1}

On questioning the patient, the history of irregular menstruation, amenorrhea for the last 6 months, and repeated renal colic since she was 20 years old, for which she has required lithotripsy on several occasions, stand out. She also has a family history of renoureteral colic. What is her suspected diagnosis? The patient's history of repeated renal colic, lithotripsy, and family history of renoureteral colic suggests a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism, as kidney stones are a common complication of hypercalcemia. The presence of a neuroendocrine tumor in the pancreas, along with the history of irregular menstruation and amenorrhea, suggests a possible diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome, where multiple endocrine glands are affected.

In the histopathological study of the corresponding specimen, teeth, hairs, areas of intestinal epithelium, areas of squamous epithelium (15%) and bronchial epithelium, as well as neuroectodermal and embryonic elements are found in several of the histological preparations. In reference to this case, point out the correct diagnosis: The presence of teeth, hairs, and various types of epithelium (intestinal, squamous, and bronchial) in the histopathological study suggests a tumor composed of tissues from multiple germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm), which is a characteristic of teratomas. The fact that embryonic and neuroectodermal elements are also present, and that the tumor is solid-cystic, suggests that it is an immature teratoma, as opposed to a mature teratoma which would have more differentiated tissues. The presence of these immature elements also rules out a mature cystic teratoma.

Mark the CORRECT statement: The patient's symptoms, such as progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, are consistent with heart failure. The presence of bilateral crackles on auscultation also supports this diagnosis, as it suggests pulmonary congestion. Additionally, the holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla is consistent with mitral insufficiency, which is a common complication of heart failure. The gallop rhythm, specifically the third and fourth heart sounds, are also characteristic of heart failure, as they indicate abnormal ventricular filling patterns.

An abdominal ultrasound shows a mass of 1.5 cm in diameter in the pancreatic tail. Among the following, your primary diagnostic suspicion is: The patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, flushing, and facial reddening, accompanied by hypokalemia, are consistent with a neuroendocrine tumor that produces vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The presence of a pancreatic mass in the ultrasound supports this diagnosis.

On examination there is right thoracic hypophonesis and tympanism on percussion.What is the presumptive diagnosis? : The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and oxygen saturation is decreased, suggesting respiratory distress. The presence of right thoracic hypophonesis and tympanism on percussion indicates an abnormality in the right lung field. Tympanism is a characteristic finding of air in the pleural space, which is consistent with a pneumothorax. The patient's other vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate, are not suggestive of cardiac tamponade or massive hemothorax. The Glasgow scale score of 15 indicates that the patient is awake and alert, making a pulmonary contusion less likely.

Which of the following seems to you to be the most appropriate first diagnostic approach? The patient is a 64-year-old woman with two days of vaginal bleeding, which is a concerning symptom in a postmenopausal woman. The first diagnostic approach should be to evaluate the endometrium, as it is a common source of bleeding in this age group. Transvaginal ultrasound is a non-invasive and widely available test that can provide information about endometrial thickness, which can be a indicator of endometrial pathology. If the endometrial thickness is abnormal, an endometrial biopsy can be performed to obtain a tissue diagnosis.

She presented a diarrhea stool a few hours after the onset of the symptoms. Examination revealed abdominal distension, tympanism and increased bowel sounds, but no peritoneal irritation. Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities. The abdominal X-ray showed dilatation of the small bowel loops, without gas in the rectal ampulla. Regarding this case it is true that: The patient's symptoms, including vomiting, abdominal distension, and increased bowel sounds, are consistent with a bowel obstruction. The abdominal X-ray showing dilatation of the small bowel loops without gas in the rectal ampulla also supports this diagnosis. The fact that the patient had a diarrheal stool does not rule out intestinal obstruction, as it may be a result of the obstruction itself. In this case, the patient's condition is not yet peritonitic, and a conservative approach with serum therapy, nasogastric aspiration, and close monitoring is a reasonable initial management strategy before considering surgical intervention.", "options": {"1": "Initial management should be conservative, with serum therapy, nasogastric aspiration and periodic clinical, analytical and radiographic monitoring.", "2": "The fact that the patient presented a diarrheal stool allows us to exclude the diagnosis of intestinal obstruction.

Which of the following tests would be most useful in diagnosing the cause of the pleural effusion? The pleural fluid analysis suggests an exudative effusion due to the high protein level and lactate dehydrogenase. The lymphocytic predominance and absence of malignant cells point towards an inflammatory or infectious process. Considering the patient's origin from Cameroon, where tuberculosis is endemic, and the chronic nature of the symptoms, tuberculosis should be suspected.

The patient's history of smoking and heavy drinking also increases the likelihood of a head and neck cancer. The absence of symptoms related to the primary tumor, such as dysphagia or hoarseness, makes it less likely that the primary tumor is located in the esophagus or larynx. The parotid gland is also an unlikely location, as it is typically associated with adenocarcinoma or lymphoma, rather than squamous cell carcinoma. The scalp is a possible location, but it is less common than another location in the head and neck region that is closely related to the jugulodigastric lymph node. Therefore, the most likely location of the primary tumor is in the upper aerodigestive tract, specifically in the oropharynx or nasopharynx, which commonly metastasize to the jugulodigastric lymph node.", "options": {"1": "Lung.", "2": "Parotid.", "3": "Scalp.", "4": "Esophagus.", "5": "Larynx."}, "correct_option": 5}

Taking into account the most probable diagnosis in the clinical picture described, what is the complementary test of choice to confirm this clinical diagnosis? The clinical picture suggests a diagnosis of pyloric stenosis, which is a common cause of vomiting in infants. The \"squirting\" food content and permanent hunger are indicative of a gastric outlet obstruction. The blood gas analysis shows a metabolic alkalosis, which is consistent with the loss of hydrochloric acid and potassium in the vomit. The complementary test of choice to confirm this diagnosis would be an imaging study that can visualize the pylorus and rule out other causes of gastric outlet obstruction.

Which of the following seems to you to be the most appropriate first diagnostic approach? The patient is a 64-year-old woman with two days of vaginal bleeding, which is a concerning symptom in a postmenopausal woman. The first diagnostic approach should be to evaluate the endometrium, as it is a common source of bleeding in this age group. Transvaginal ultrasound is a non-invasive and widely available test that can provide information about endometrial thickness, which can be a indicator of endometrial pathology.

What would be the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent an emboligenic stroke with anticoagulation therapy: The number needed to treat (NNT) is calculated as the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). The ARR is the difference between the event rate in the control group and the event rate in the treatment group. In this case, the event rate in the control group (without warfarin) is 5.2% and the event rate in the treatment group (with warfarin) is 2.2%. The ARR is therefore 5.2% - 2.2% = 3%.

He goes to the genetic consultation with his wife, to assess the risks of transmission of the disease. What correct information will be provided in the course of the genetic counseling? Since the disease is caused by a partial deletion in the dystrophin gene located on the X chromosome, it follows an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. As the father has the disease, he will transmit the mutated gene to all his daughters, who will be carriers.

The first attitude will be: The patient presents with acute cervical pain radiating to the left arm, accompanied by paresthesia in the radial border of the forearm, without objectifiable loss of strength. This clinical picture suggests a herniated disc or a cervical spine lesion that is compressing a nerve root, likely C6 or C7, which corresponds to the radial border of the forearm. Given that the patient has no red flags such as severe weakness, bowel or bladder dysfunction, or signs of spinal cord compression, a conservative approach is reasonable.

Which of the following complementary tests would you NOT perform according to the most probable diagnoses? The patient's symptoms, such as heartburn and dysphagia, especially with solid foods, are highly suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The patient's respiratory rate and decreased peak flow indicate that they are not improving despite initial treatment. The p02 is low, but the pC02 is not elevated, suggesting that the patient is not in respiratory failure. The patient's symptoms and exam findings are consistent with a severe asthma exacerbation. In this setting, increasing oxygen flow is not likely to significantly improve the patient's condition, as they are already on 28% oxygen and their p02 is not severely low.

In reference to this case, point out the correct diagnosis: The presence of teeth, hairs, and various types of epithelium (intestinal, squamous, and bronchial) in the histopathological study suggests a tumor composed of tissues from multiple germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm), which is a characteristic of teratomas. The fact that embryonic and neuroectodermal elements are also present, and that the tumor is solid-cystic, suggests that it is an immature teratoma, as opposed to a mature teratoma which would have more differentiated tissues.

Indicate which diagnostic tests would be necessary to confirm the most likely diagnosis: The patient's laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, a type of plasma cell cancer that can cause bone fractures and abnormalities in blood tests. The presence of anemia (low hemoglobin), hypoproteinemia (low total proteins), and hypoalbuminemia (low serum albumin) are consistent with this diagnosis. The elevated beta 2 microglobulin level also supports this diagnosis, as it is a tumor marker for multiple myeloma.

Twenty days after starting treatment, a report of rifampicin resistance of M. tuberculosis isolated in sputum is received. Which regimen would you select based on this report? Rifampicin is a crucial component of the initial treatment regimen for pulmonary tuberculosis, and its resistance necessitates a change in the treatment strategy. Since the patient has already received 20 days of treatment, it is reasonable to assume that the other medications, namely isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, have been effective in reducing the bacterial load.

This patient's epilepsy is classified as partial epilepsy because the seizures start with a specific area of the brain, in this case, the right frontal lobe, as evidenced by the neuroradiological study. The fact that the seizures are accompanied by involuntary movements of the left limbs, which is a focal neurological sign, also supports the diagnosis of partial epilepsy. Furthermore, the seizures are secondarily generalized, as they lead to loss of consciousness, which is a characteristic of generalized seizures.

The patient presents with palpebral hematoma, hyposphagmia, and diplopia to the upper vision with limitation of the upper version of the eyeball. This suggests an orbital floor fracture, which can cause entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle, leading to the described ocular motility deficits. The inferior rectus muscle is responsible for upward gaze, and its entrapment would cause limitation of the upper version of the eyeball, consistent with the patient's symptoms.", "options": {"1": "Dentoalveolar fracture.", "2": "Fracture of the inferior wall of the floor of the orbit with entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle.", "3": "", "4": "Fracture of the superior wall of the orbit with entrapment of the superior rectus muscle.", "5": "Zygomatic arch fracture."}, "correct_option": 2}

An urgent ultrasound shows a normal liver, vesicular cholesterosis and absence of bile duct dilatation, with no other alterations of interest. What is the most likely diagnosis? The patient presents with jaundice, choluria, and acholia, indicating a cholestatic picture. The absence of abdominal pain, weight loss, and other symptoms, along with the normal liver and vesicular cholesterosis on ultrasound, points towards an obstructive cause. The absence of bile duct dilatation makes a mechanical obstruction unlikely, such as cholangiocarcinoma or biliary mud.

The patient's elevated PSA level, abnormal rectal examination, and family history of prostate cancer increase the suspicion of prostate cancer. Given the abnormal findings, the next step would be to further investigate the prostate tissue to determine if cancer is present. This can be achieved through a transrectal ultrasound and prostate biopsy, which would provide a tissue diagnosis and guide further management.", "options": {"1": "Suggest to the patient the performance of a transrectal ultrasound and prostate biopsy.", "2": "Initiate combined treatment of LHRH analogues and antiandrogens.", "3": "Initiate treatment with 5 alpha Reductase Inhibitors to reduce PSA levels by half.", "4": "Perform a bone scan.", "5": "Perform an abdominopelvic CT scan."}, "correct_option": 1}

The patient started treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide, with adequate tolerance. Twenty days after starting treatment, a report of rifampicin resistance of M. tuberculosis isolated in sputum is received. Which regimen would you select based on this report? Rifampicin is a crucial component of the initial treatment regimen for pulmonary tuberculosis, and its resistance necessitates a change in the treatment strategy. Since the patient has already received 20 days of treatment, it is reasonable to assume that the other medications, namely isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, have been effective in reducing the bacterial load. To ensure effective treatment, a new regimen should be designed to overcome the rifampicin resistance.

On questioning, she reports occasional dysuria and her general condition is good. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? The patient's symptoms of vulvar pruritus, especially the recent development of a small lump on the left labium majus that leaks serohaematically on rubbing, suggest a neoplastic process. The presence of dysuria and the patient's age also support this diagnosis.

Which of the following diagnoses is the most likely: The patient presents with dyspneic sensation and arterial blood gases showing hypoxemia (pO2 of 70 mmHg), which suggests a respiratory problem. The normal pulmonary auscultation and absence of murmurs rule out cardiopulmonary disease. The presence of a prolonged APTT ratio of 2, with a normal prothrombin time, suggests a circulating anticoagulant that is interfering with the intrinsic coagulation pathway, which is consistent with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism due to a hypercoagulable state, likely related to an acquired thrombophilia.", "options": {"1": "Hemophilia.", "2": "Acute pericarditis.", "3": "Factor V of Leiden.", "4": "", "5": "Antiphospholipid syndrome."}, "correct_option": 5}

The presence of coralliform lithiasis in the abdominal ultrasound, along with the patient's symptoms of fever and right lumbar pain, strongly suggests a diagnosis of pyelonephritis. In the context of pyelonephritis, the most common causative microorganism is a Gram-negative bacillus that is commonly found in the gut and can ascend to the kidneys, causing infection. This microorganism is also known to be a common cause of urinary tract infections, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms.", "options": {"1": "Enterococcus faecalis.", "2": "Salmonella typhi.", "3": "Candida albicans.", "4": "Escherichia coli.", "5": "Proteus mirabilis."}, "correct_option": 5}

However, the bicarbonate level is also elevated, which suggests that there is a metabolic component to the disturbance. This is because the body would normally increase bicarbonate levels to compensate for a respiratory acidosis, but in this case, the bicarbonate level is higher than expected, indicating that there is also a metabolic alkalosis present.

What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient's condition? The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with liver damage, as evidenced by the presence of jaundice, painful hepatomegaly, and abnormal liver function tests, including elevated bilirubin, AST, ALT, and GGT levels. The patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption and recent increase in drinking due to family problems suggests a direct link between the liver damage and alcohol abuse. Furthermore, the presence of asterixis, a flapping tremor of the hands, is a common finding in patients with liver encephalopathy, which is often seen in patients with severe liver damage. The patient's abnormal coagulation profile, as indicated by the prolonged prothrombin time, is also consistent with liver dysfunction.

The patient presents with proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia, which are all characteristics of nephrotic syndrome. The absence of microhematuria and normal renal function suggest a glomerular disease without a significant inflammatory component. The complete remission of the symptoms after one month of corticosteroid treatment is consistent with a steroid-responsive nephropathy.

The patient's symptoms, specifically the bilateral paralysis of the upper extremities, are inconsistent with a primary psychiatric disorder. The lack of concern or anxiety about her condition, despite its severity, is also unusual. However, the recent stressful event in her life, specifically the arrest of her son, suggests a possible psychological trigger for her symptoms.

Chest X-ray and ECG without alterations Which of the following complementary tests is the least necessary for the detection of lesions in target organs? The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest hypertension with poor blood pressure control, which can lead to target organ damage. The determination of glycosylated hemoglobin is not necessary for the detection of lesions in target organs, as it is a test used to monitor glucose control in diabetic patients, and the patient's glucose level, although slightly elevated, does not indicate diabetes.

The patient's symptoms, such as progressive, mildly painful skin lesions on his left arm, starting from an erythematous lesion on his left thumb, and visible reddish striae as connecting lines between the lesions, are consistent with a lymphocutaneous infection. The fact that the patient had been working in his garden and did not remember any injuries suggests an inoculation of the pathogen through a minor trauma. Additionally, the diagnosis was made by culture of a skin biopsy, which is a common diagnostic method for this type of infection.

After a diagnostic evaluation that ruled out other anomalies and being in a stable respiratory condition, surgical intervention was decided. On what basis was the priority to intervene in this patient based? The priority to intervene in this patient was based on the risk of aspiration pneumonitis, which is a serious complication that can occur in esophageal atresia due to the accumulation of saliva and gastric secretions in the esophageal pouch, which can then be aspirated into the lungs, leading to respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.", "options": {"1": "Because of frequently associated cardiac malformations.", "2": "Due to the impossibility of swallowing saliva.", "3": "Because of the risk of aspiration pneumonitis.", "4": "Due to the impossibility of enteral feeding.", "5": "Associated tracheomalacia."}, "correct_option": 3}

An alternative is to perform a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and discharge him to his residence. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action for this patient? The patient's refusal to eat and deteriorating condition are likely driven by his psychotic depression, which has been exacerbated by the recent loss of his sister. Since he is physically able to eat, it is possible that his nutritional status can improve with the resumption of his medications.

Which of the following is the most plausible cause of her headache? The patient's symptoms are consistent with tension headache, which is the most common type of headache in adults. The description of the pain as a \"weight\" and its location in the occipital and temporal regions are typical of tension headache. The fact that the pain is not completely relieved by paracetamol and has worsened over time also supports this diagnosis.

The presence of immature elements, such as neuroectodermal and embryonal elements, suggests that this is not a purely mature teratoma, but rather a mixture of mature and immature components, which is consistent with a mature cystic teratoma with immature elements.", "options": {"1": "Dysgerminoma.", "2": "Immature teratoma.", "3": "Mature cystic teratoma.", "4": "Teratocarcinoma.", "5": ""}, "correct_option": 3}
{"question": "A 32-year-old man, ADVP and recently released from prison, has a protein derivative skin test (PPD) with 10 mm of induration. One year ago, the PPD was negative, he is currently asymptomatic, his HIV serology is negative, and his Chest X-ray is normal. Which of the following approaches do you think is most appropriate? This patient has a recent conversion of the PPD, from negative to positive, which indicates a high likelihood of recent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although the patient is asymptomatic and has a normal chest X-ray, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that individuals with a recent conversion of the PPD, especially those with a high risk of exposure such as prisoners, receive treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Isoniazid is the recommended medication for LTBI, and the duration of treatment is 9 months, which has been shown to be effective in preventing the development of active tuberculosis.", "options": {"1": "Isoniazid for 9 months.", "2": "Treatment with RIF and PRZ for 2 months.", "3": "Do not perform treatment and annual Rx control.", "4": "Treatment with 4 drugs 4 months.", "5": "Sputum culture for mycobacteria and treat only if positive."}, "correct_option": 1}
{"question": "A 40-year-old woman, with no personal or family history of interest, presents several days of watery diarrhea, very abundant, accompanied by loss of 10 kg of weight, flushing and facial reddening, together with lipothymias and colicky abdominal pain, with hypokalemia in the laboratory data. An abdominal ultrasound shows a mass of 1.5 cm in diameter in the pancreatic tail. Among the following, your primary diagnostic suspicion is: The patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, flushing, and facial reddening, accompanied by hypokalemia, are consistent with a neuroendocrine tumor that produces vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The presence of a pancreatic mass in the ultrasound supports this diagnosis. VIPoma is a rare pancreatic endocrine tumor that produces excessive amounts of VIP, leading to a characteristic syndrome of watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and facial flushing. The weight loss and abdominal pain are also consistent with this diagnosis.", "options": {"1": "PPoma.", "2": "Glucagonoma.", "3": "VIPoma.", "4": "", "5": "Insulinoma."}, "correct_option": 3}
{"question": "37-week pregnant woman with positive hepatitis B virus surface antigen. She consults about the guidelines to be followed with the newborn and whether she can breastfeed. What advice do you think is most appropriate? The newborn is at risk of contracting hepatitis B from the mother, so administration of hepatitis B vaccine and immunoglobulins at birth is recommended to provide passive and active immunity. Breastfeeding is not a contraindication for hepatitis B, as the risk of transmission through breast milk is low. In fact, the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the risks, and the mother can breastfeed her newborn while taking precautions to ensure good hygiene.", "options": {"1": "Administer hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Artificial feeding.", "2": "Vaccination and immunoglobulins at birth. Maternal feeding.", "3": "Vaccination and immunoglobulins should be administered at birth. Breastfeeding from one month onwards.", "4": "Immunoglobulins at birth and artificial breastfeeding.", "5": "Artificial feeding and isolation for 4 weeks."}, "correct_option": 2}
{"question": "A 45-year-old woman presents arterial hypertension (190/120 mmHg) accompanied by K 2.5 mEq/l. An abdominal ultrasound shows stenosis of both renal arteries. Indicate which treatment is contraindicated: In the presence of bilateral renal artery stenosis, the use of ACE inhibitors (such as enalapril) is contraindicated because they can further reduce glomerular filtration rate, leading to acute kidney injury. This is because ACE inhibitors block the angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole, which is a compensatory mechanism to maintain glomerular filtration pressure in the setting of renal artery stenosis.", "options": {"1": "Amlodipine.", "2": "Amiloride.", "3": "Prazosin.", "4": "Enalapril.", "5": "Propanolol."}, "correct_option": 4}
{"question": "55-year-old man who consults for dysphonia. In the anamnesis he refers to a month of asthenia and unquantified weight loss. Chest X-ray shows increased density in the left upper lobe and occupation of the aortopulmonary window. Bronchoscopy shows paralysis of the left vocal cord, without endoscopic image suggestive of neoplasia. What is the most likely diagnosis? The patient presents with dysphonia due to paralysis of the left vocal cord, which suggests involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The occupation of the aortopulmonary window on chest X-ray is consistent with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The combination of these findings, along with the patient's symptoms of asthenia and weight loss, suggests a malignant process, likely a neoplasm, that has spread to the mediastinum and is compressing the recurrent laryngeal nerve, causing vocal cord paralysis.", "options": {"1": "Sarcoidosis.", "2": "Pulmonary neoplasia.", "3": "", "4": "Tuberculosis.", "5": "Silicosis."}, "correct_option": 2}
{"question": "An 80-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus who suddenly presents with language impairment. On arrival at the hospital, an unknown atrial fibrillation is observed, and on examination she presents fluent speech with a tendency to slurred speech, poor language comprehension, inability to repeat and dysnomia. Semiologically she presents a picture compatible with: The patient presents with fluent speech, poor language comprehension, inability to repeat, and dysnomia. These symptoms are consistent with a receptive aphasia, where the patient has difficulty understanding language. The presence of fluent speech with a tendency to slurred speech also supports this diagnosis. The combination of these symptoms suggests a Wernicke's aphasia, which is typically caused by a lesion in the posterior superior temporal gyrus, often due to embolic infarction, as in this case with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation.", "options": {"1": "Sensitive transcortical aphasia.", "2": "", "3": "Wernicke's aphasia.", "4": "Conduction aphasia.", "5": "Broca's aphasia."}, "correct_option": 3}
