{"question": "Juan is 60 years old, has been smoking 2 packs/day for years and has reported a persistent cough for the last 6 months. He notes that his left eyelid is more droopy and that the pupil of this eye is smaller. John reports that the medial side of his left hand is numb and with less strength. His physician checks for palpebral ptosis and left miosis; he checks that he can close both eyelids symmetrically and that both pupils respond correctly to light. In addition, he checks that there is no sweating from the left hemiface, that he feels less prickling on the inner surface of the left hand and that he has less strength in the grip of the left hand. Regarding the ocular symptomatology, where is the lesion located? The symptoms described, including ptosis (drooping of the eyelid) and miosis (constriction of the pupil), suggest a lesion affecting the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for pupil dilation and eyelid elevation. The fact that the patient's pupils respond correctly to light and he can close both eyelids symmetrically rules out a lesion in the parasympathetic nervous system or the common ocular motor nerve.

{"question": "A 56-year-old female patient consulted for dorso-lumbar spine pain and progressive difficulty in performing usual tasks. In the last 5 years she gained weight, she has ecchymosis easily and arterial hypertension was detected. Physical examination: Obesity of central predominance, rounded facies, increased supraclavicular fat, decreased proximal muscle strength and some reddish striae in the abdomen. She has a blood glucose of 136 mg/dL and the radiological study showed osteoporosis and vertebral crushing. What do you think is the most coherent interpretation and attitude? The patient presents with a combination of symptoms and signs that are highly suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, such as central obesity, rounded facies, increased supraclavicular fat, easy bruising, and reddish striae on the abdomen. The presence of osteoporosis and vertebral compression fractures also supports this diagnosis. Given the high likelihood of Cushing's syndrome, it is necessary to investigate further to confirm the diagnosis and determine its etiology. This can be done by measuring urinary free cortisol and basal ACTH levels, which will help to distinguish between Cushing's disease (pituitary adenoma) and Cushing's syndrome (adrenal tumor or ectopic ACTH production).", "options": {"1": "It looks like Cushing's. If basal ACTH is high, it may be due to corticosteroid use or an adrenal tumor, and an MRI should be performed.", "2": "It is necessary to rule out Cushing's disease by dexamethasone suppression test and perform a cranial CT scan.", "3": "Probably has Cushing's. If the basal ACTH is low, he probably has a pituitary micro-adenoma, and a cranial CT scan should be performed.", "4": "Postmenopausal osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus and essential hypertension, with decreased strength due to diabetic polyneuropathy.", "5": "Suggest Cushing's. Determine urinary free cortisol and basal ACTH, which serves to orient its etiology and select the most appropriate imaging technique."}, "correct_option": 5}

{"question": "A 64-year-old patient, farmer, former smoker (5 years), COPD and afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis on corticosteroid therapy. He consults the emergency department for presenting intense headache of 2 days of evolution with deviation of the oral commissure. As background, he reports that after a month of influenza, he persists with cough, purulent and occasionally hemoptotic expectoration, febrile fever, anorexia, asthenia and weight loss. On arrival, the patient had a fever of 38.2\u00baC, multiple skin abscesses on the hands, back and buttocks (some with fistulous tracts) and right central facial paralysis, apical infiltrates with small associated pleural effusion on chest X-ray and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. Among the following suspected diagnoses I would consider MOST likely: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Nocardiosis. The presence of a chronic cough, purulent expectoration, and apical infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest a pulmonary infection. The skin abscesses, fistulous tracts, and right central facial paralysis (consistent with a peripheral nerve lesion) indicate disseminated disease. The patient's immunocompromised state due to corticosteroid therapy for rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of opportunistic infections, such as Nocardiosis. Additionally, the patient's history of COPD and influenza a month prior to presentation increases the likelihood of a secondary infection. The symptoms and findings are not consistent with a lung neoplasm with brain metastases, as there is no evidence of a primary lung tumor or brain lesions.", "options": {"1": "Aspergillosis.", "2": "", "3": "Lung neoplasm with brain metastases.", "4": "Nocardiosis.", "5": "Disseminated tuberculosis."}, "correct_option": 1}

The absence of anti-HBs antibodies suggests that the patient has not developed immunity against the virus. The presence of anti-HBe antibodies and the absence of HBeAg indicate that the virus is not actively replicating. The presence of IgG anti-HBc antibodies indicates a past infection, and the presence of HBV DNA indicates that the virus is still present in the blood. This scenario is consistent with a chronic hepatitis B infection, where the virus is persistently present in the blood, but the patient is not actively replicating the virus and has not developed immunity.

Biochemistry: AST 30 IU/L, ALT 35 IU/L, GGT 59 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 105 IU/L, LDH 490 IU/L, urea 20 mg/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL. Taking into account the available information, indicate which of the following additional analytical parameters you would need to know in order to make the most appropriate immediate decision: The patient presents with a severe anemia (Hb 6 gr/dL) with a high MCV (105 fL), which suggests a hemolytic anemia. The presence of an elevated LDH (490 IU/L) supports this diagnosis. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, it is essential to determine the cause of the hemolysis.

Oxygen saturation is 89 %. Respiratory syncytial virus is isolated in the nasopharyngeal exudate. Which of the following treatments do you consider more indicated for this condition? In this case, the infant is experiencing moderate respiratory distress with oxygen saturation of 89%, which is below normal. Supplemental oxygen is essential to help improve oxygenation and alleviate respiratory distress. The other treatments may have some benefits, but they are not as crucial as providing oxygen in this scenario.", "options": {"1": "", "2": "Intravenous corticosteroids.", "3": "Oral rivabirin.", "4": "Nebulized salbutamol.", "5": "Supplemental oxygen."}, "correct_option": 5}
{"question": "A 67-year-old female patient on ticlopidine treatment comes to the emergency department with headache, asthenia and petechiae in the lower extremities. Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin 8.2 g/dL, MCV 100 fl, platelets 25000/ul and leukocytes 7500/ul with normal formula. The reticulocyte count was elevated and the blood smear showed numerous schistocytes. Coagulation studies (APTT, PT and fibrinogen) are normal. The biochemistry shows LDH 2700 IU/l and bilirubin 2.6 mg/dl. What is the most likely diagnosis? The presence of schistocytes in the blood smear, elevated LDH, and bilirubin levels suggest a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The thrombocytopenia and normal coagulation studies rule out disseminated intravascular coagulation. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a thrombotic microangiopathy, which is a known side effect of ticlopidine treatment.", "options": {"1": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.", "2": "Disseminated intravascular coagulation.", "3": "Drug-induced thrombopenia.", "4": "Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura.", "5": "Bone marrow aplasia."}, "correct_option": 1}
