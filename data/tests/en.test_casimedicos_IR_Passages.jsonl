{"question": "A 32-year-old woman requests preconception counseling. The patient reports that she underwent cervical conization for a high-grade intraepithelial lesion (H-SIL) and subsequently had three miscarriages between 20 and 22 weeks gestation. She has no living children. On all three occasions she came to the emergency department with a feeling of weight in the hypogastrium, where she was found to be 8 cm dilated and with prominent amniotic membranes. She had never felt contractions before, what advice would you give her for the next pregnancy? Events after 42 weeks are considered postterm. When a pregnancy exceeds 42 weeks, the risk of complications for both the woman and the fetus increases significantly. Therefore, in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy, obstetricians usually prefer to induce labour at some stage between 41 and 42\nstillbirths account for parity values being less than the gravida number. In the case of a multiple birth the gravida number and parity value are increased by one only. Women who have never carried a pregnancy achieving more than 20 weeks of gestation age are referred to as \"nulliparous\".\nThe success rate for cervical cerclage is approximately 80-90% for elective cerclages, and 40-60% for emergency cerclages. A cerclage is considered successful if labor and delivery is delayed to at least 37 weeks (full term).

Accuracy of pulse oximetry is limited in the 76% to 90% range and there is weak correlation between oxygen saturation and respiratory distress as brief hypoxemia is common in healthy infants. Additionally, pulse oximetry is associated with frequent false alarms\nInfants with bronchiolitis between the age of two and three months have a second infection by bacteria (usually a urinary tract infection) less than 6% of the time. When further evaluated with a urinalysis, infants with bronchiolitis had a concomitant UTI 0.8% of the time.

{"question": "A 67-year-old female patient on ticlopidine treatment comes to the emergency department with headache, asthenia and petechiae in the lower extremities. Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin 8.2 g/dL, MCV 100 fl, platelets 25000/ul and leukocytes 7500/ul with normal formula. The reticulocyte count was elevated and the blood smear showed numerous schistocytes. Coagulation studies (APTT, PT and fibrinogen) are normal. The biochemistry shows LDH 2700 IU/l and bilirubin 2.6 mg/dl. What is the most likely diagnosis? Measurements of blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase, platelets, and schistocytes are used to monitor disease progression or remission. ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor levels may be measured during follow-up, but in those without symptoms the use of rituximab is not recommended.\nLaboratory tests for thrombocytopenia might include full blood count, liver enzymes, kidney function, vitamin B levels, folic acid levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and peripheral blood smear. If the cause for the low platelet count remains unclear, a bone marrow biopsy is usually recommended\nfifth, the platelet count normalized completely; this response rate is similar to that found in treatment with rituximab, which is more expensive and less safe.
