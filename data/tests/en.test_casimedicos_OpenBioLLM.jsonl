{"question": "An 18-month-old boy, with complete immunization schedule to date, who consults the Emergency Department for right knee swelling after playing in the park, without obvious trauma.

The ultrasound examination is compatible with hemarthrosis and in the analytical analysis only an APTT lengthening of 52'' (normal 25-35'') stands out. What is the most probable diagnostic hypothesis?  The most probable diagnostic hypothesis is Hemophilia A. This is because Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of clotting factor VIII. It is characterized by large post-traumatic ecchymoses, hematomas, and hemarthroses, which can occur spontaneously or after minor trauma. The prolonged APTT in the absence of correction with mixing test and normal PT suggests a deficiency of a factor involved in the intrinsic pathway, which is consistent with Hemophilia A.

Therefore, the most appropriate management would be to add adjuvant analgesics that are effective for neuropathic pain, such as amitriptyline or gabapentin. Additionally, dexamethasone can be considered to reduce inflammation and potentially alleviate pain.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and Microscopic polyangiitis do not typically present with nasal symptoms and crusts, while Polyarteritis nodosa does not usually involve the lungs or kidneys. Therefore, the clinical findings strongly support the diagnosis of Granulomatosis with polyangiitis.", "options": {"1": "", "2": "Microscopic polyangiitis.", "3": "Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.", "4": "Polyarteritis nodosa.", "5": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis."}, "correct_option": 5}

However, its specificity is not as high, meaning that it can sometimes give a positive result when the person is not actually infected with HIV. This is why a positive ELISA test is not enough for a definitive diagnosis of HIV infection; further confirmatory tests are needed. In the case of a negative ELISA test, it is unlikely that the patient has been infected with HIV, but it does not completely rule out the possibility. PCR technique cannot be used to determine viral load in blood if the ELISA test is negative because PCR is used to detect the genetic material of the virus, which would not be present if the patient is not infected.

Several males of the maternal family had died in childhood due to infectious processes. Physical examination showed lesions typical of atopic dermatitis. The immunological study showed a slight decrease in T-lymphocyte subpopulations; elevated IgA and IgE; decreased IgM and IgG at the lower limit of normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?  The most likely diagnosis for this 2-year-old boy is Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by recurrent infections, such as acute otitis media, meningococcal meningitis, and pneumonia, which are consistent with the patient's history. The presence of thrombocytopenic purpura, normal megakaryocytes in bone marrow, and negative antiplatelet antibodies also align with this diagnosis. The family history of males dying in childhood due to infectious processes suggests an X-linked inheritance pattern, which is characteristic of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Additionally, the immunological findings of slightly decreased T-lymphocyte subpopulations, elevated IgA and IgE, and decreased IgM and IgG at the lower limit of normal are consistent with this syndrome. Atopic dermatitis is also commonly associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, family history, and immunological findings, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.", "options": {"1": "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.", "2": "Common variable immunodeficiency.", "3": "Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of childhood.", "4": "Hyper IgE syndrome.", "5": "X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency."}, "correct_option": 5}

This is because, despite receiving a Fi02 of 1.0 (100% oxygen), the patient's Pa02 is only 60 mmHg, indicating inadequate oxygenation. Atelectasis, as seen on the chest X-ray, can lead to a short circuit where oxygen is not effectively delivered to the alveoli, resulting in hypoxemia. Other factors such as hypoventilation, low inspired 02 pressure, and neuromuscular disease are less likely given the clinical scenario and the interventions already performed (oro-tracheal intubation and assisted ventilation).", "options": {"1": "", "2": "Low inspired 02 pressure.", "3": "Neuromuscular disease.", "4": "Short circuit.", "5": "Hypoventilation."}, "correct_option": 4}

She consulted for intermittent scanty metrorrhagia of 2 months of evolution. The gynecological examination showed external genitalia without lesions, an atrophic cervix, a normal uterus and appendages on palpation and a normal cytological study of the cervix. The transvaginal ultrasound study shows a 7 mm hyperechogenic endometrium. Which of the following tests is the most appropriate and most sensitive to establish a diagnosis?  The most appropriate and sensitive test to establish a diagnosis in this case is hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy. This procedure allows direct visualization of the uterine cavity and the ability to obtain tissue samples for histopathological examination. It is particularly useful in cases of abnormal uterine bleeding, such as the one described, where it can help identify endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, or cancer.

{"question": "A 19-year-old girl with no medical history of interest, except for a self-limited case of influenza 3 weeks earlier, who comes to the emergency department with petechiae and ecchymosis of spontaneous onset. On physical examination the patient was in good general condition, afebrile, normotensive and oriented in time and space. There were petechiae scattered throughout the lower extremities and abdomen and small ecchymoses in decubitus areas. No lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly were palpated. Laboratory tests showed the following findings: Hb 12.6 g/dL, leukocytes 5,500/mm3, platelets 7000/mm3. The peripheral blood smear showed normal erythrocyte morphology, normal differential leukocyte count and the planetary count was concordant with the autoanalyzer figure without platelet aggregates. Biochemistry and proteinogram, beta 2 microglobulin and LDH are normal. Which of the following do you think is the most appropriate initial treatment?  The most appropriate initial treatment for a 19-year-old girl presenting with petechiae and ecchymosis, a low platelet count (7000/mm3), and normal coagulation tests is likely immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). ITP is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of platelets in the spleen, leading to a low platelet count and a tendency to bleed. The absence of lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, along with the normal coagulation tests, rules out other causes of low platelet count such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).  In the case of ITP, the primary goal of treatment is to increase the platelet count and prevent bleeding. Platelet transfusion is not indicated in this case as the underlying issue is not a lack of platelet production but rather their increased destruction.

In the case of a 2-month-old infant presenting with moderate respiratory distress, expiratory wheezing, and a confirmed Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, the most indicated treatment would be supplemental oxygen. This is because RSV infections can lead to bronchiolitis, which is characterized by inflammation and obstruction of the small airways, resulting in inadequate oxygenation. Supplemental oxygen is crucial to maintain adequate oxygen saturation levels and support respiratory function. While bronchodilators such as nebulized salbutamol may be used in some cases, they are not as effective in the treatment of bronchiolitis as they are in asthma. Oral rivabirin is an antiviral medication that can be considered in certain cases of RSV infection, but it is not the first-line treatment.
