{"question": "Juan is 60 years old, has been smoking 2 packs/day for years and has reported a persistent cough for the last 6 months. He notes that his left eyelid is more droopy and that the pupil of this eye is smaller. John reports that the medial side of his left hand is numb and with less strength. His physician checks for palpebral ptosis and left miosis; he checks that he can close both eyelids symmetrically and that both pupils respond correctly to light. In addition, he checks that there is no sweating from the left hemiface, that he feels less prickling on the inner surface of the left hand and that he has less strength in the grip of the left hand. Regarding the ocular symptomatology, where is the lesion located? Juan's symptoms include left eyelid ptosis, left miosis, lack of sweating on the left hemiface, and sensory and motor deficits on the medial side of the left hand. These symptoms suggest Horner's syndrome, which involves disruption of sympathetic pathways. The sympathetic fibers responsible for eyelid elevation and pupil dilation traverse from the hypothalamus, through the brainstem, then down to the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord (particularly in the lower cervical and upper thoracic segments), and subsequently to the superior cervical ganglion. Disruption at any point along this pathway can explain Juan's ocular symptoms.

What is the most probable diagnosis: The development of tachypnea, tachycardia, sweating, and progressive cyanosis in a patient with acute pancreatitis, combined with a PaO2 of 55 mm Hg and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 200, suggests significant hypoxemia. Bilateral alveolar pulmonary infiltrates on CXR and normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, along with lack of improvement with oxygen therapy, are indicative of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
