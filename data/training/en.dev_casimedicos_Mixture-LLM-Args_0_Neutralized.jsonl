Physical examination is normal. The most indicated examination in this situation is:  The most indicated examination in this situation is Hemoglobin electrophoresis. This is because the laboratory findings suggest a microcytic anemia with low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), along with low ferritin levels. These findings are suggestive of iron deficiency anemia, which is the most common cause of microcytic anemia. However, to rule out other causes such as thalassemia or sickle cell disease, which can also present with microcytic anemia, hemoglobin electrophoresis is necessary.

{"question": "A 35-year-old woman consults for a right thyroid nodule detected incidentally one morning when she observed in the mirror a lump on the anterior aspect of the neck. After the pertinent studies, it was decided to operate on the patient, performing a total thyroidectomy with emptying of the central lymph node component. The pathologist's report was that the 2.3 cm thyroid nodule was entirely occupied by a papillary thyroid carcinoma, tall cell variant, without vascular infiltration but with capsular infiltration. Thyroglobulin concentrations 24 h after thyroidectomy are 14 ng/mL. What would be the next step you would take in this patient?  Given the patient's postoperative thyroglobulin levels of 14 ng/mL and the pathologist's report indicating capsular infiltration without vascular invasion, the next step would be to delay the initiation of TSH replacement-suppressive treatment with levothyroxine and refer the patient to the Nuclear Medicine service for administration of an ablative dose of 100 mCi of I131. This is because the presence of capsular infiltration suggests the possibility of residual microscopic disease, and radioactive iodine ablation is indicated to eliminate any residual thyroid tissue or microscopic disease that may not have been detected on the initial surgery.

Examination of sensibility and osteotendinous reflexes shows no alterations. External rotation maneuvers and resisted abduction, with the hip in 90 degrees of flexion, reproduce the pain. The most probable diagnosis is:  The symptoms described by the patient, including discomfort in the right buttock after prolonged sitting, numbness in the right lower limb that disappears upon standing, and pain reproduction with specific hip maneuvers, are indicative of Piriformis syndrome. This condition occurs when the piriformis muscle, which crosses the greater sciatic foramen, compresses the sciatic nerve, leading to symptoms such as buttock pain and lower limb numbness. The absence of abnormalities on MRI and hip X-ray, as well as normal sensory and reflex examinations, further supports this diagnosis, as it is often not associated with structural abnormalities visible on imaging.

A complete blood count is normal and proteinuria is negative. What type of hypertension is present?  The correct diagnosis in this case is chronic hypertension. This is because the woman has elevated blood pressure on two occasions, which is consistent with the definition of chronic hypertension. Additionally, the absence of proteinuria and the normal complete blood count help rule out preeclampsia, which typically presents with these findings. Eclampsia is also ruled out as the woman does not have seizures.

After the pertinent studies, it was decided to operate on the patient, performing a total thyroidectomy with emptying of the central lymph node component. The pathologist's report was that the 2.3 cm thyroid nodule was entirely occupied by a papillary thyroid carcinoma, tall cell variant, without vascular infiltration but with capsular infiltration. Thyroglobulin concentrations 24 h after thyroidectomy are 14 ng/mL. What would be the next step you would take in this patient?  Given the patient's postoperative thyroglobulin levels of 14 ng/mL and the pathologist's report indicating capsular infiltration without vascular invasion, the next step would be to delay the initiation of TSH replacement-suppressive treatment with levothyroxine and refer the patient to the Nuclear Medicine service for administration of an ablative dose of 100 mCi of I131. This is because the presence of capsular infiltration suggests the possibility of residual microscopic disease, and radioactive iodine ablation is indicated to eliminate any residual thyroid tissue or microscopic disease that may not have been detected on the initial surgery.

Methacholine test is indicated in this case because the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of asthma, such as intermittent cough and wheezing, especially at night. The normal chest X-ray and spirometry with negative bronchodilator test suggest that the airflow obstruction is not fixed, which is consistent with asthma.

The clinical presentation of a 74-year-old patient with fatigue, bone pain, anemia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and radiolucent bands perpendicular to the cortex on the inner side of the upper femur is consistent with a diagnosis of osteomalacia. Osteomalacia is a softening of the bones due to a defect in bone mineralization, often related to a deficiency of vitamin D or problems with its metabolism. This can lead to weakened bones and an increased risk of fractures, as seen in the patient's Colles' fracture. The laboratory findings of low calcium, low phosphate, and elevated alkaline phosphatase are indicative of impaired bone mineralization.

On examination, the mother presents two café-au-lait spots and attends the genetic counseling consultation with her new partner where a preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is proposed. Is PGD indicated in this case?  PGD is indicated in this case after detection of the causative mutation in the index case and eventually in the mother. This is because neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the neurofibromin gene (17q11.2). While the presence of two café-au-lait spots in the mother is suggestive, it is not definitive for a diagnosis of NF1 carrier status. To ensure accurate risk assessment and selection of unaffected embryos, PGD should only be performed after the specific mutation has been identified in the affected individual (index case) and confirmed in the mother if she is indeed a carrier.

This approach is chosen because it allows for accurate visualization of the cyst and its relationship to the biliary system, which is crucial for planning the surgical intervention. Radical resection of the entire bile duct is not indicated as it is not necessary to replace it with a loop of bowel in this case. Percutaneous puncture or drainage alone is not sufficient as it does not address the underlying cause of the cyst and may lead to recurrence. An exploratory laparotomy alone is not indicated as it does not provide detailed information about the cyst's location and extent, which is necessary for a successful resection. HIDA scintigraphy is not necessary in this case as the ultrasound has already confirmed the presence of the cyst and its location. Therefore, the most appropriate therapeutic approach is to perform a cholangioresonance to delimit the cyst and then proceed with laparotomy for resection and biliary tract anastomosis.", "options": {"1": "HIDA scintigraphy is necessary to delimit the cyst and to be able to perform percutaneous drainage safely.", "2": "An exploratory laparotomy and drainage of the cyst will be indicated and when the dilatation subsides the drainage will be removed.", "3": "A percutaneous puncture will be performed for peritoneal lavage to check that the cyst contains bile in order to leave a drainage to improve abdominal pain.", "4": "A cholangioresonance will be performed to delimit the cyst and a laparotomy will be indicated for resection of the cyst and anastomosis of the biliary tract.", "5": "Radical resection of the entire bile duct is indicated to replace it with a loop of bowel."}, "correct_option": 4}

Examination of sensibility and osteotendinous reflexes shows no alterations. External rotation maneuvers and resisted abduction, with the hip in 90 degrees of flexion, reproduce the pain. The most probable diagnosis is:  The symptoms described by the patient, including discomfort in the right buttock after prolonged sitting, numbness in the right lower limb that disappears upon standing, and pain reproduction with specific hip maneuvers, are indicative of Piriformis syndrome. This condition occurs when the piriformis muscle, which crosses the greater sciatic foramen, compresses the sciatic nerve, leading to symptoms such as buttock pain and lower limb numbness. The absence of abnormalities on MRI and hip X-ray, as well as normal sensory and reflex examinations, further supports this diagnosis, as it is often not associated with structural abnormalities visible on imaging. The reproduction of pain with external rotation maneuvers and resisted abduction suggests the involvement of the piriformis muscle in the compression of the sciatic nerve.", "options": {"1": "", "2": "Pyramidal syndrome.", "3": "Tensor fascia lata syndrome.", "4": "Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome.", "5": "S1 radiculopathy."}, "correct_option": 2}

{"question": "A 35-year-old woman consults for a right thyroid nodule detected incidentally one morning when she observed in the mirror a lump on the anterior aspect of the neck. After the pertinent studies, it was decided to operate on the patient, performing a total thyroidectomy with emptying of the central lymph node component. The pathologist's report was that the 2.3 cm thyroid nodule was entirely occupied by a papillary thyroid carcinoma, tall cell variant, without vascular infiltration but with capsular infiltration. Thyroglobulin concentrations 24 h after thyroidectomy are 14 ng/mL. What would be the next step you would take in this patient? In cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma, especially the tall cell variant which is more aggressive, post-operative management should include radioactive iodine (I131) ablation to eliminate any remaining thyroid tissue and potential microscopic disease. Delaying the initiation of TSH replacement therapy is important until after the ablation, as elevated TSH levels facilitate the uptake of radioactive iodine by any remaining thyroid tissue.

The laboratory tests show leukocytosis with left deviation, indicating a bacterial infection. The presence of increased creatinine and CK levels suggests muscle damage and rhabdomyolysis. The lack of traumatic history and the presence of parenteral drug use as a risk factor point towards a specific type of bacterial infection. The clinical picture and laboratory findings are consistent with a severe bacterial infection that causes myonecrosis and sepsis, which is commonly seen in parenteral drug users.", "options": {"1": "Erysipelas.", "2": "Gangrene due to Clostridium spp.", "3": "Mycobacterial cellulitis.", "4": "", "5": "Streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis."}, "correct_option": 5}
{"question": "A 45-year-old male patient with a history of uric lithiasis with repeated expulsive nephritic colic for 25 years, comes to the ED referring palpitations and intense right lumbar pain since 2 hours before. Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform? The patient's symptoms of palpitations and intense right lumbar pain, along with the ECG confirmation of atrial fibrillation, suggest a possible underlying electrolyte imbalance or metabolic disorder. The urinalysis results showing a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria point towards a potential kidney stone or nephrolithiasis. The blood biochemistry results showing an elevated calcium level and LDH further support this suspicion. Given the patient's history of uric lithiasis and repeated expulsive nephritic colic, the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform would be an imaging study that can visualize the kidneys and urinary tract to confirm the presence of a kidney stone.", "options": {"1": "Simple abdominal X-ray.", "2": "Abdominal echography.", "3": "CT with contrast.", "4": "IVU.", "5": "Doppler echocardiography."}, "correct_option": 3}
